    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. INTRODUCING MR. PETER RUFF
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was nothing about the supper party on that particular Sunday evening
      in November at Daisy Villa, Green Street, Streatham, which seemed to
      indicate in any way that one of the most interesting careers connected
      with the world history of crime was to owe its very existence to the
      disaster which befell that little gathering. The villa was the residence
      and also&mdash;to his credit&mdash;the unmortgaged property of Mr. David
      Barnes, a struggling but fairly prosperous coal merchant of excellent
      character, some means, and Methodist proclivities. His habit of sitting
      without his coat when carving, although deprecated by his wife and
      daughter on account of the genteel aspirations of the latter, was a not
      unusual one in the neighbourhood; and coupled with the proximity of a cold
      joint of beef, his seat at the head of the table, and a carving knife and
      fork grasped in his hands, established clearly the fact of his position in
      the household, which a somewhat weak physiognomy might otherwise have led
      the casual observer to doubt. Opposite him, at the other end of the table,
      sat his wife, Mrs. Barnes, a somewhat voluminous lady with a high colour,
      a black satin frock, and many ornaments. On her left the son of the house,
      eighteen years old, of moderate stature, somewhat pimply, with the fashion
      of the moment reflected in his pink tie with white spots, drawn through a
      gold ring, and curving outwards to seek obscurity underneath a dazzling
      waistcoat. A white tube-rose in his buttonhole might have been intended as
      a sort of compliment to the occasion, or an indication of his intention to
      take a walk after supper in the fashionable purlieus of the neighbourhood.
      Facing him sat his sister&mdash;a fluffy-haired, blue-eyed young lady,
      pretty in her way, but chiefly noticeable for a peculiar sort of
      self-consciousness blended with self-satisfaction, and possessed only at a
      certain period in their lives by young ladies of her age. It was almost
      the air of the cat in whose interior reposes the missing canary, except
      that in this instance the canary obviously existed in the person of the
      young man who sat at her side, introduced formally to the household for
      the first time. That young man&rsquo;s name was&mdash;at the moment&mdash;Mr.
      Spencer Fitzgerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems idle to attempt any description of a person who, in the past, had
      secured a certain amount of fame under a varying personality; and who, in
      the future, was to become more than ever notorious under a far less
      aristocratic pseudonym than that by which he was at present known to the
      inhabitants of Daisy Villa. There are photographs of him in New York and
      Paris, St. Petersburg and Chicago, Vienna and Cape Town, but there are no
      two pictures which present to the casual observer the slightest likeness
      to one another. To allude to him by the name under which he had won some
      part, at least, of the affections of Miss Maud Barnes, Mr. Spencer
      Fitzgerald, as he sat there, a suitor on probation for her hand, was a
      young man of modest and genteel appearance. He wore a blue serge suit&mdash;a
      little underdressed for the occasion, perhaps; but his tie and collar were
      neat; his gold-rimmed spectacles&mdash;if a little disapproved of by Maud
      on account of the air of steadiness which they imparted&mdash;suggested
      excellent son-in-lawlike qualities to Mr. and Mrs. Barnes. He had the
      promise of a fair moustache, but his complexion generally was colourless.
      His features, except for a certain regularity, were undistinguished. His
      speech was modest and correct. His manner varied with his company.
      To-night it had been pronounced, by excellent judges&mdash;genteel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation consisted&mdash;naturally enough, under the circumstances&mdash;of
      a course of subtle and judicious pumping, tactfully prompted, for the most
      part, by Mrs. Barnes. Such, for instance, as the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking about Marie Corelli&rsquo;s new book reminds me, Mr. Fitzgerald&mdash;your
      occupation is connected with books, is it not?&rdquo; his prospective
      mother-in-law enquired, artlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fitzgerald bowed assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am cashier at Howell &amp; Wilson&rsquo;s in Cheapside,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We sell a
      great many books there&mdash;as many, I should think, as any retail
      establishment in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; Mrs. Barnes purred. &ldquo;Very interesting work, I am sure. So nice
      and intellectual, too; for, of course, you must be looking inside them
      sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the place well,&rdquo; Mr. Adolphus Barnes, Junior, announced
      condescendingly,&mdash;&ldquo;pass it every day on my way to lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much nicer,&rdquo; Mrs. Barnes continued, &ldquo;than any of the ordinary
      businesses&mdash;grocery or drapery, or anything of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Maud elevated her eyebrows slightly. Was it likely that she would
      have looked with eyes of favour upon a young man engaged in any of these
      inferior occupations?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s money in books, too,&rdquo; Mr. Barnes declared with sudden
      inspiration. His prospective son-in-law turned towards him deferentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, sir,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;There is money in them. There&rsquo;s money
      for those who write, and there&rsquo;s money for those who sell. My occupation,&rdquo;
       he continued, with a modest little cough, &ldquo;brings me often into touch with
      publishers, travellers and clerks, so I am, as it were, behind the scenes
      to some extent. I can assure you,&rdquo; he continued, looking from Mr. Barnes
      to his wife, and finally transfixing Mr. Adolphus&mdash;&ldquo;I can assure you
      that the money paid by some firms of publishers to a few well-known
      authors&mdash;I will mention no names&mdash;as advances against royalties,
      is something stupendous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Mr. Barnes murmured, solemnly shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie Corelli, I expect, and that Hall Caine,&rdquo; remarked young Adolphus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems easy enough to write a book, too,&rdquo; Mrs. Barnes said. &ldquo;Why, I
      declare that some of those we get from the library&mdash;we subscribe to a
      library, Mr. Fitzgerald&mdash;are just as simple and straightforward that
      a child might have written them. No plot whatsoever, no murders or
      mysteries or anything of that sort&mdash;just stories about people like
      ourselves. I don&rsquo;t see how they can pay people for writing stories about
      people just like those one meets every day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always say,&rdquo; Maud intervened, &ldquo;that Spencer means to write a book some
      day. He has quite the literary air, hasn&rsquo;t he, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed he has!&rdquo; Mrs. Barnes declared, with an appreciative glance at the
      gold-rimmed spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fitzgerald modestly disclaimed any literary aspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing is a gift, after all,&rdquo; he declared, generously. &ldquo;I can keep
      accounts, and earn a fair salary at it, but if I attempted fiction I
      should soon be up a tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barnes nodded his approval of such sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one to his trade, I say,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;What sort of salaries do
      they pay now in the book trade?&rdquo; he asked guilelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fair,&rdquo; Mr. Fitzgerald admitted candidly,&mdash;&ldquo;very fair indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was your age,&rdquo; Mr. Barnes said reflectively, &ldquo;I was getting&mdash;let
      me see&mdash;forty-two shillings a week. Pretty good pay, too, for those
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fitzgerald admitted the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said apologetically, &ldquo;salaries are a little higher now all
      round. Mr. Howell has been very kind to me,&mdash;in fact I have had two
      raises this year. I am getting four pounds ten now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four pounds ten per week?&rdquo; Mrs. Barnes exclaimed, laying down her knife
      and fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Mr. Fitzgerald answered. &ldquo;After Christmas, I have some reason
      to believe that it may be five pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barnes whistled softly, and looked at the young man with a new
      respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you that&mdash;Mr.&mdash;that Spencer was doing pretty well,
      Mother,&rdquo; Maud simpered, looking down at her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one to support?&rdquo; her father asked, transferring a pickle from the
      fork to his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; Mr. Fitzgerald answered. &ldquo;In fact, I may say that I have some
      small expectations. I haven&rsquo;t done badly, either, out of the few
      investments I have made from time to time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saved a bit of money, eh?&rdquo; Mr. Barnes enquired genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a matter of four hundred pounds put by,&rdquo; Mr. Fitzgerald admitted
      modestly, &ldquo;besides a few sticks of furniture. I never cared much about
      lodging-house things, so I furnished a couple of rooms myself some time
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Barnes rose slowly to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite sure you won&rsquo;t have a small piece more of beef?&rdquo; she
      enquired anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a morsel?&rdquo; Mr. Barnes asked, tapping the joint insinuatingly with
      his carving knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you!&rdquo; Mr. Fitzgerald declared firmly. &ldquo;I have done
      excellently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if you will put the joint on the sideboard, Adolphus,&rdquo; Mrs. Barnes
      directed, &ldquo;Maud and I will change the plates. We always let the girl go
      out on Sundays, Mr. Fitzgerald,&rdquo; she explained, turning to their guest.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very awkward, of course, but they seem to expect it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite natural, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Mr. Fitzgerald murmured, watching Maud&rsquo;s light
      movements with admiring eyes. &ldquo;I like to see ladies interested in domestic
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I will say for Maud,&rdquo; her proud mother declared,
      plumping down a dish of jelly upon the table, &ldquo;she does know what&rsquo;s what
      in keeping house, and even if she hasn&rsquo;t to scrape and save as I did when
      David and I were first married, economy is a great thing when you&rsquo;re
      young. I have always said so, and I stick to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, Mother,&rdquo; Mr. Barnes declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If instead of sitting there,&rdquo; Mrs. Barnes continued in high good humour,
      &ldquo;you were to get a bottle of that port wine out of the cellarette, we
      might drink Mr. Fitzgerald&rsquo;s health, being as it&rsquo;s his first visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barnes rose to his feet with alacrity. &ldquo;For a woman with sound ideas,&rdquo;
       he declared, &ldquo;commend me to your mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maud, having finished her duties, resumed her place by the side of the
      guest of the evening. Their hands met under the tablecloth for a moment.
      To the girl, the pleasure of such a proceeding was natural enough, but
      Fitzgerald asked himself for the fiftieth time why on earth he, who,
      notwithstanding his present modest exterior, was a young man of some
      experience, should from such primitive love-making derive a rapture which
      nothing else in life afforded him. He was, at that moment, content with
      his future,&mdash;a future which he had absolutely and finally decided
      upon. He was content with his father-in-law and his mother-in-law, with
      Daisy Villa, and the prospect of a Daisy Villa for himself,&mdash;content,
      even, with Adolphus! But for Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, these things were not
      to be! The awakening was even then at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dining room of Daisy Villa fronted the street, and was removed from it
      only a few feet. Consequently, the footsteps of passers-by upon the
      flagged pavement were clearly distinguishable. It was just at the moment
      when Mrs. Barnes was inserting a few fresh almonds into a somewhat
      precarious tipsy cake, and Mr. Barnes was engaged with the decanting of
      the port, that two pairs of footsteps, considerably heavier than those of
      the ordinary promenader, paused outside and finally stopped. The gate
      creaked. Mr. Barnes looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Visitors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all listened. The front-door bell rang. Adolphus, in response to a
      gesture from his mother, rose sulkily to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Job I hate!&rdquo; he muttered as he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the family, full of the small curiosity of people of their
      class, were intent upon listening for voices outside. The demeanour of Mr.
      Spencer Fitzgerald, therefore, escaped their notice. It is doubtful, in
      any case, whether their perceptions would have been sufficiently keen to
      have enabled them to trace the workings of emotion in the countenance of a
      person so magnificently endowed by Providence with the art of subterfuge.
      Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald seemed simply to have stiffened in acute and
      earnest attention. It was only for a moment that he hesitated. His
      unfailing inspiration told him the truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      His course of action was simple,&mdash;he rose to his feet and strolled to
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people who have lost their way in the fog, perhaps,&rdquo; he remarked.
      &ldquo;What a night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hand upon the sash&mdash;simultaneously there was a rush of
      cold air into the room, a half-angry, half-frightened exclamation from
      Adolphus in the passage, a scream from Miss Maud&mdash;and no Mr. Spencer
      Fitzgerald! No one had time to be more than blankly astonished. The door
      was opened, and a police inspector, in very nice dark braided uniform and
      a peaked cap, stood in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barnes dropped the port, and Mrs. Barnes, emulating her daughter&rsquo;s
      example, screamed. The inspector, as though conscious of the draught,
      moved rapidly toward the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a visitor here, Mr. Barnes,&rdquo; he said quickly&mdash;&ldquo;a Mr. Spencer
      Fitzgerald. Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no one who could answer! Mr. Barnes was speechless between the
      shock of the spilt port and the appearance of a couple of uniformed
      policemen in his dining room. John Dory, the detective, he knew well
      enough in his private capacity, but in his uniform, and attended by
      policemen, he presented a new and startling appearance! Mrs. Barnes was in
      hysterics, and Maud was gazing like a creature turned to stone at the open
      window, through which little puffs of fog were already drifting into the
      room. Adolphus, with an air of bewilderment, was standing with his mouth
      and eyes wider open than they had ever been in his life. And as for the
      honoured guest of these admirable inhabitants of Daisy Villa, there was
      not the slightest doubt but that Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald had disappeared
      through the window!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitzgerald&rsquo;s expedition was nearly at an end. Soon he paused, crossed the
      road to a block of flats, ascended to the eighth floor by an automatic
      lift, and rang the bell at a door which bore simply the number II. A trim
      parlourmaid opened it after a few minutes&rsquo; delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Miss Emerson at home?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Emerson is in,&rdquo; the maid admitted, with some hesitation, &ldquo;but I am
      not sure that she will see any one to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a message for her,&rdquo; Fitzgerald said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give me your name, sir, please?&rdquo; the maid asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inner door was suddenly opened. A slim girl, looking taller than she
      really was by reason of the rug upon which she stood, looked out into the
      hall&mdash;a girl with masses of brown hair loosely coiled on her head,
      with pale face and strange eyes. She opened her lips as though to call to
      her visitor by name, and as suddenly closed them again. There was not much
      expression in her face, but there was enough to show that his visit was
      not unwelcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Come in! Please come in at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fitzgerald obeyed the invitation of the girl whom he had come to visit.
      She had retreated a little into the room, but the door was no sooner
      closed than she held out her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Peter, you have come to me at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips were a little parted; her eyes were bright with pleasure; her
      whole expression was one of absolute delight. Fitzgerald frowned, as
      though he found her welcome a little too enthusiastic for his taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t look at me as though I were a prodigal
      sheep. If you do, I shall be sorry that I came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands fell to her side, the pleasure died out of her face&mdash;only
      her eyes still questioned him. Fitzgerald carefully laid his hat on a
      vacant chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has happened?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tell me that all that madness is over&mdash;that
      you are yourself again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as regards my engagement with Messrs. Howell &amp; Wilson,&rdquo; he
      said, despondently, &ldquo;you are right. As regards&mdash;Miss Barnes, there
      has been no direct misunderstanding between us, but I am afraid, for the
      present, that I must consider that&mdash;well, in abeyance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is something!&rdquo; she exclaimed, drawing a little breath of relief.
      &ldquo;Sit down, Peter. Will you have something to eat? I finished dinner an
      hour ago, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Fitzgerald interrupted, &ldquo;I supped&mdash;extremely well in
      Streatham!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Streatham!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Why, how did you get there? The fog is
      awful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fogs do not trouble me,&rdquo; Fitzgerald answered. &ldquo;I walked. I could have
      done it as well blindfold. I will take a whisky and soda, if I may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led him to an easy-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will mix it myself,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without being remarkably good-looking, she was certainly a pleasant and
      attractive-looking young woman. Her cheeks were a little pale; her hair&mdash;perfectly
      natural&mdash;was a wonderful deep shade of soft brown. Her eyes were long
      and narrow&mdash;almost Oriental in shape&mdash;and they seemed in some
      queer way to match the room; he could have sworn that in the firelight
      they flashed green. Her body and limbs, notwithstanding her extreme
      slightness, were graceful, perhaps, but with the grace of the tigress. She
      wore a green silk dressing jacket, pulled together with a belt of lizard
      skin, and her neck was bare. Her skirt was of some thin black material.
      She was obviously in deshabille, and yet there was something neat and trim
      about the smaller details of her toilette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, please, Peter,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;You are keeping me in suspense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to tell,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a sharp breath through her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to marry that girl&mdash;that bourgeois doll in
      Streatham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fitzgerald sat up in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, seriously, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you call her names. If I&rsquo;m not
      going to marry her, it isn&rsquo;t my fault. She is the only girl I have ever
      wanted, and probably&mdash;most probably&mdash;she will be the only one I
      ever shall want. That&rsquo;s honest, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is honest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have married her,&rdquo; the young man continued, &ldquo;and I should have
      been happy. I had my eye on a villa&mdash;not too near her parents&mdash;and
      I saw my way to a little increase of salary. I should have taken to
      gardening, to walks in the Park, with an occasional theatre, and I should
      have thoroughly enjoyed a fortnight every summer at Skegness or
      Sutton-on-Sea. We should have saved a little money. I should have gone to
      church regularly, and if possible I should have filled some minor public
      offices. You may call this bourgeois&mdash;it was my idea of happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is still,&rdquo; he declared, sharply, &ldquo;but I shall never attain to it.
      To-night I had to leave Maud&mdash;to leave the supper table of Daisy
      Villa&mdash;through the window!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;That brute Dory was at the bottom of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;you told me that you had a bona-fide
      situation&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I had,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;and I was a fool not to be content with it. It
      was my habit of taking long country walks, and their rotten auditing,
      which undid me! You understand that this was all before I met Maud? Since
      the day I spoke to her, I turned over a new leaf. I have left the night
      work alone, and I repaid every penny of the firm&rsquo;s money which they could
      ever have possibly found out about. There was only that one little affair
      of mine down at Sudbury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you are going to do?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no alternative,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The law has kicked me out from the
      respectable places. The law shall pay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with glowing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any plans?&rdquo; she asked, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have considered the subject from a good many
      points of view, and I have decided to start in business for myself as a
      private detective.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Peter!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you be a little more original?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is only what I am going to call myself,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I may tell
      you that I am going to strike out on somewhat new lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please explain,&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recrossed his knees and made himself a little more comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The weak part of every great robbery, however successful,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;is
      the great wastage in value which invariably results. For jewels which cost&mdash;say
      five thousand pounds, and to procure which the artist has to risk his life
      as well as his liberty, he has to consider himself lucky if he clears
      eight hundred. For the Hermitage rubies, for instance, where I nearly had
      to shoot a man dead, I realized rather less than four hundred pounds. It
      doesn&rsquo;t pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not clear,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;how far this class of business will
      attract me at all, but I do not propose, in any case, to enter into any
      transactions on my own account. I shall work for other people, and for
      cash down. Your experience of life, Violet, has been fairly large. Have
      you not sometimes come into contact with people driven into a situation
      from which they would willingly commit any crime to escape if they dared?
      It is not with them a question of money at all&mdash;it is simply a matter
      of ignorance. They do not know how to commit a crime. They have had no
      experience, and if they attempt it, they know perfectly well that they are
      likely to blunder. A person thoroughly experienced in the ways of
      criminals&mdash;a person of genius like myself&mdash;would have, without a
      doubt, an immense clientele, if only he dared put up his signboard.
      Literally, I cannot do that. Actually, I mean to do so! I shall be willing
      to accept contracts either to help nervous people out of an undesirable
      crisis; or, on the other hand, to measure my wits against the wits of
      Scotland Yard, and to discover the criminals whom they have failed to
      secure. I shall make my own bargains, and I shall be paid in cash. I shall
      take on nothing that I am not certain about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your clients?&rdquo; she asked, curiously. &ldquo;How will you come into contact
      with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not afraid of business being slack,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The world is full of
      fools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot live outside the law, Peter,&rdquo; she objected. &ldquo;You are clever, I
      know, but they are not all fools at Scotland Yard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; he reminded her, &ldquo;that there will be a perfectly legitimate
      side to my profession. The other sort of case I shall only accept if I can
      see my way clear to make a success of it. Needless to say, I shall have to
      refuse the majority that are offered to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came a little nearer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; she said, with a little sigh, &ldquo;you have given up that
      foolish, bourgeois life of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down into her face, and his eyes were cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is no time for misunderstandings. I should like
      you to know that apart from one young lady, who possesses my whole
      affection&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of it?&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All!&rdquo; he declared emphatically. &ldquo;She will doubtless be faithless to me&mdash;under
      the circumstances, I cannot blame her&mdash;but so far as I am concerned,
      I have no affection whatever for any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She crept back to her place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could be so useful to you,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could and you shall, if you will be sensible,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how?&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you acting now?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am understudying Molly,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and I have a very small part at
      the Globe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no reason to interfere with that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in fact, I wish you
      to continue your connection with the profession. It brings you into touch
      with the class of people among whom I am likely to find clients.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, please,&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On two conditions&mdash;or rather one,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you can, if you like,
      become my secretary and partner&mdash;and find the money we shall require
      to make a start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conditions?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must understand, once and for all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I will not be made
      love to, and that I can treat you only as a working; companion. My name
      will be Peter Ruff, and yours Miss Brown. You will have to dress like a
      secretary, and behave like one. Sometimes there will be plenty of work for
      you, and sometimes there will be none at all. Sometimes you will be bored
      to death, and sometimes there will be excitement. I do not wish to make
      you vain, but I may add, especially as you are aware of my personal
      feelings toward you, that you are the only person in the world to whom I
      would make this offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Peter,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;when do you mean to start this new
      enterprise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for six months&mdash;perhaps a year,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I must go to
      Paris&mdash;perhaps Vienna. I might even have to go to New York. There are
      certain associations with which I must come into touch&mdash;certain
      information I must become possessed of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I like your scheme, but there is just one thing. Such
      men as you should be the brains of great enterprises. Don&rsquo;t you understand
      what I mean? It shouldn&rsquo;t be you who does the actual thing which brings
      you within the power of the law. I am not over-scrupulous, you know. I
      hate wrongdoing, but I have never been able to treat as equal criminals
      the poor man who steals for a living, and the rich financier who robs
      right and left out of sheer greed. I agree with you that crime is not an
      absolute thing. The circumstances connected with every action in life
      determine its morality or immorality. But, Peter, it isn&rsquo;t worth while to
      go outside the law!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a sensible girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have always thought that. We&rsquo;ll
      talk over my cases together, if they seem to run a little too close to the
      line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Peter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I accept.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER II. A NEW CAREER
    </h2>
    <p>
      About twelve months after the interrupted festivities at Daisy Villa, that
      particular neighbourhood was again the scene of some rejoicing. Standing
      before the residence of Mr. Barnes were three carriages, drawn in each
      case by a pair of grey horses. The coachmen and their steeds were
      similarly adorned with white rosettes. It would have been an insult to the
      intelligence of the most youthful of the loungers-by to have informed them
      that a wedding was projected.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the neighbouring church all was ready. The clerk stood at the door, the
      red drugget was down, the usual little crowd were standing all agog upon
      the pavement. There was one unusual feature of the proceedings: Instead of
      a solitary policeman, there were at least a dozen who kept clear the
      entrance to the church. Their presence greatly puzzled a little old
      gentleman who had joined the throng of sightseers. He pushed himself to
      the front and touched one of them upon the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Policeman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you tell me why there are so many of you
      to keep such a small crowd in order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bridegroom&rsquo;s a member of the force, sir, for one reason,&rdquo; the man
      answered good-humouredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other?&rdquo; the old gentleman persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman behaved as though he had not heard&mdash;a proceeding which
      his natural stolidity rendered easy. The little old gentleman, however,
      was not so easily put off. He tapped the man once more upon the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other reason, Mr. Policeman?&rdquo; he asked insinuatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not allowed to talk about that, sir,&rdquo; was the somewhat gruff reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little old gentleman moved away, a trifle hurt. He was a very nicely
      dressed old gentleman indeed, and everything about him seemed to savour of
      prosperity. But he was certainly garrulous. An obviously invited guest was
      standing upon the edge of the pavement stroking a pair of lavender kid
      gloves. The little old gentleman sidled up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; he said, raising his hat. &ldquo;I am just back from
      Australia&mdash;haven&rsquo;t seen a wedding in England for fifty years. Do you
      think that they would let me into the church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The invited guest looked down at his questioner and approved of him.
      Furthermore, he seemed exceedingly glad to be interrupted in his somewhat
      nervous task of waiting for the wedding party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; he replied cheerfully. &ldquo;Come along in with me, and I&rsquo;ll
      find you a seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down the scarlet drugget they went&mdash;the big best man with the red
      hands and the lavender kid gloves and the opulent-looking old gentleman
      with the gold-rimmed spectacles and the handsome walking stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, this is very interesting!&rdquo; the latter remarked. &ldquo;Is it the
      custom, sir, always, may I ask, in this country, to have so many policemen
      at a wedding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big man looked downward and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Special reason,&rdquo; he said mysteriously. &ldquo;Fact is, young lady was engaged
      once to a very bad character&mdash;a burglar whom the police have been
      wanting for years. He had to leave the country, but he has written her
      once or twice since in a mysterious sort of way&mdash;wanted her to be
      true to him, and all that sort of thing. Dory&mdash;that&rsquo;s the bridegroom&mdash;has
      got a sort of an idea that he may turn up to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very exciting&mdash;very!&rdquo; the little old gentleman remarked.
      &ldquo;Reminds me of our younger days out in Australia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sit down here,&rdquo; the best man directed, ushering his companion into an
      empty pew. &ldquo;I must get back again outside, or I shall have the bridegroom
      arriving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day to you, sir, and many thanks!&rdquo; the little old gentleman said
      politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the bridegroom arrived&mdash;a smart young officer, well thought of
      at Scotland Yard, well set up, wearing a long tail coat a lilac and white
      tie, and shaking in every limb. He walked up the aisle accompanied by the
      best man, and the little old gentleman from Australia watched him genially
      from behind those gold-rimmed glasses. And, then, scarcely was he at the
      altar rails when through the open church door one heard the sounds of
      horses&rsquo; feet, one heard a rustle, the murmur of voices, caught a glimpse
      of a waiting group arranging themselves finally in the porch of the
      church. Maud, on the arm of her father, came slowly up the aisle. The
      little old gentleman turned his head as though this was something upon
      which he feared to look. He saw nothing of Mr. Barnes, in a new coat, with
      tuberose and spray of maidenhair in his coat, and exceedingly tight patent
      leather boots on his feet; he saw nothing of Mrs. Barnes, clad in a gown
      of the lightest magenta, with a bonnet smothered with violets.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the vestry that the only untoward incident of that highly
      successful wedding took place. The ceremony was over! Bride, bridegroom
      and parents trooped in. And when the register was opened, one witness had
      already signed! In the clear, precise writing his name stood out upon the
      virgin page&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Spencer Fitzgerald
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridegroom swore, the bride nearly collapsed. The clerk pressed into
      the hands of the latter an envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the little old gentleman,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;who was fussing round the
      church this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dory tore it open and gave a cry of delight. A diamond cross, worth
      all the rest of her presents put together, flashed soft lights from a
      background of dull velvet. Her husband had looked over her shoulder, and
      with a scowl seized the morocco case and threw it far from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the only disturbing incident of a highly successful function!
    </p>
    <p>
      At precisely the same moment when the wedding guests were seated around
      the hospitable board of Daisy Villa, a celebration of a somewhat different
      nature was taking place in the more aristocratic neighbourhood of Curzon
      Street. Here, however, the little party was a much smaller one, and the
      innocent gaiety of the gathering at Daisy Villa was entirely lacking. The
      luncheon table around which the four men were seated presented all the
      unlovely signs of a meal where self-restraint had been abandoned&mdash;where
      conviviality has passed the bounds of licence. Edibles were represented
      only by a single dish of fruit; the tablecloth, stained with wine and
      cigar ash, seemed crowded with every sort of bottle and every sort of
      glass. A magnum of champagne, empty, another half full, stood in the
      middle of the table; whisky, brandy, liqueurs of various sorts were all
      represented; glasses&mdash;some full, some empty, some filled with cigar
      ash and cigarette stumps&mdash;an ugly sight!
    </p>
    <p>
      The guest in chief arose. Short, thick-set, red-faced, with bulbous eyes,
      and veins about his temples which just now were unpleasantly prominent, he
      seemed, indeed, a very fitting person to have been the recipient of such
      hospitality. He stood clutching a little at the tablecloth and swaying
      upon his feet. He spoke as a drunken man, but such words as he pronounced
      clearly showed him to be possessed of a voice naturally thick and raspy.
      It was obvious that he was a person of entirely different class from his
      three companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G&mdash;gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must be off. I thank you very much for
      this&mdash;hospitality. Honoured, I&rsquo;m sure, to have sat down in such&mdash;such
      company. Good afternoon, all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lurched a little toward the door, but his neighbour at the table&mdash;who
      was also his host&mdash;caught hold of his coat tail and pulled him back
      into his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hurry, Masters,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One more liqueur, eh? It&rsquo;s a raw
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;not another drop, Sir Richard!&rdquo; the man declared. &ldquo;Not another
      drop to drink. I am very much obliged to you all, but I must be off. Must
      be off,&rdquo; he repeated, making another effort to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      His host held him by the arm. The man resented it&mdash;he showed signs of
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n it all! I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not a prisoner, am I?&rdquo; he exclaimed
      angrily. &ldquo;Tell you I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;appointment&mdash;club. Can&rsquo;t you see
      it&rsquo;s past five o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Masters,&rdquo; the man whom he had addressed as Sir Richard
      declared soothingly. &ldquo;We want just a word with you on business first,
      before you go&mdash;Colonel Dickinson, Lord Merries and myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Masters shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See you to-morrow,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;No time to talk business now. Let me
      go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made another attempt to rise, which his host also prevented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Masters, don&rsquo;t be a fool!&rdquo; the latter said firmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to hear
      what we want to say to you. Sit down and listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Masters relapsed sullenly into his chair. His little eyes seemed to creep
      closer to one another. So they wanted to talk business! Perhaps it was for
      that reason that they had bidden him sit at their table&mdash;had
      entertained him so well! The very thought cleared his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard lit a cigarette and leaned further back in his chair. He was a
      man apparently about fifty years of age&mdash;tall, well dressed, with
      good features, save for his mouth, which resembled more than anything a
      rat trap. He was perfectly bald, and he had the air of a man who was a
      careful liver. His eyes were bright, almost beadlike; his fingers long and
      a trifle over-manicured. One would have judged him to be what he was&mdash;a
      man of fashion and a patron of the turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Masters,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are all old friends here. We want to speak to you
      plainly. We three have had a try, as you know&mdash;Merries, Dickinson and
      myself&mdash;to make the coup of our lives. We failed, and we&rsquo;re up
      against it hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very hard, indeed,&rdquo; Lord Merries murmured softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deuced hard!&rdquo; Colonel Dickinson echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Masters was sitting tight, breathing a little hard, looking fixedly at his
      host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my own case first,&rdquo; the latter continued. &ldquo;I am Sir Richard Dyson,
      ninth baronet, with estates in Wiltshire and Scotland, and a town house in
      Cleveland Place. I belong to the proper clubs for a man in my position,
      and, somehow or other&mdash;we won&rsquo;t say how&mdash;I have managed to pay
      my way. There isn&rsquo;t an acre of my property that isn&rsquo;t mortgaged for more
      than its value. My town house&mdash;well, it doesn&rsquo;t belong to me at all!
      I have twenty-six thousand pounds to pay you on Monday. To save my life, I
      could not raise twenty-six thousand farthings! So much for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man Masters ground his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for you!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the case next,&rdquo; Sir Richard continued, &ldquo;of my friend Merries here.
      Merries is an Earl, it is true, but he never had a penny to bless himself
      with. He&rsquo;s tried acting, reporting, marrying&mdash;anything to make an
      honest living. So far, I am afraid we must consider Lord Merries as
      something of a failure, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rotten failure, I should say,&rdquo; that young nobleman declared gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Merries is, to put it briefly, financially unsound,&rdquo; Sir Richard
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the amount of your debt to Mr. Masters, Jim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleven thousand two hundred pounds,&rdquo; Lord Merries answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we may take it, I presume, for granted that you have not that sum,
      nor anything like it, at your disposal?&rdquo; Sir Richard asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a fiver!&rdquo; Lord Merries declared with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We come now, Mr. Masters, to our friend Colonel Dickinson,&rdquo; Sir Richard
      continued. &ldquo;Colonel Dickinson is, perhaps, in a more favourable situation
      than any of us. He has a small but regular income, and he has expectations
      which it is not possible to mortgage fully. At the same time, it will be
      many years before they can&mdash;er&mdash;fructify. He is, therefore, with
      us in this somewhat unpleasant predicament in which we find ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut it short,&rdquo; Masters growled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of so much talk. What&rsquo;s it all
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means simply this, Mr. Masters,&rdquo; Sir Richard said, &ldquo;we want you to
      take six months&rsquo; bills for our indebtedness to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Masters rose to his feet. His thick lips were drawn a little apart. He had
      the appearance of a savage and discontented animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been asked here and fed up with wine and stuff, eh?&rdquo;
       he exclaimed thickly. &ldquo;Well, my answer to you is soon given. NO! I&rsquo;ll take
      bills from no man! My terms are cash on settling day&mdash;cash to pay or
      cash to receive. I&rsquo;ll have no other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard rose also to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Masters, I beg of you to be reasonable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You will do
      yourself no good by adopting this attitude. Facts are facts. We haven&rsquo;t
      got a thousand pounds between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that sort of a tale before,&rdquo; Masters answered, with a sneer.
      &ldquo;Job Masters is too old a bird to be caught by such chaff. I&rsquo;ll take my
      risks, gentlemen. I&rsquo;ll take my risks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved toward the door. No one spoke a word. The silence as he crossed
      the room seemed a little ominous. He looked over his shoulder. They were
      all three standing in their places, looking at him. A vague sense of
      uneasiness disturbed his equanimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No offence, gents,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and good afternoon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still no reply. He reached the door and turned the handle. The door was
      fast. He shook it&mdash;gently at first, and then violently. Suddenly he
      realized that it was locked. He turned sharply around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What game&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he exclaimed, fiercely. &ldquo;Let me out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood in their places without movement. There was something a little
      ominous in their silence. Masters was fast becoming a sober man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me out of here,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll break the door down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard Dyson came slowly towards him. There was something in his
      appearance which terrified Masters. He raised his fist to strike the door.
      He was a fighting man, but he felt a sudden sense of impotence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Masters,&rdquo; Sir Richard said suavely, &ldquo;the truth is that we cannot
      afford to let you go&mdash;unless you agree to do what we have asked. You
      see we really have not the money or any way of raising it&mdash;and the
      inconvenience of being posted you have yourself very ably pointed out.
      Change your mind, Mr. Masters. Take those bills. We&rsquo;ll do our best to meet
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; Masters answered, striking the door
      fiercely with his clenched fist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have cash&mdash;nothing but the
      cash!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a dull, sickening thud, and the bookmaker went over like a shot
      rabbit. His legs twitched for a moment&mdash;a little moan that was
      scarcely audible broke from his lips. Then he lay quite still. Sir Richard
      bent over him with the life preserver still in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; he muttered, hoarsely. &ldquo;One blow! Thank Heaven, he didn&rsquo;t
      want another! His skull was as soft as pudding! Ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away. The man who lay stretched upon the floor was an ugly
      sight. His two companions, cowering over the table, were not much better.
      Dyson&rsquo;s trembling fingers went out for the brandy decanter. Half of what
      he poured out was spilled upon the tablecloth. The rest he drank from a
      tumbler, neat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nervous work, this, you fellows,&rdquo; he said, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hellish!&rdquo; Dickinson answered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have some air in the room. By
      God, it&rsquo;s close!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank back into his chair, white to the lips. Dyson looked at him
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I hold you both to our bargain! I was to be
      the one he attacked and who struck the blow&mdash;in self-defence!
      Remember that&mdash;it was in self-defence! I&rsquo;ve done it! I&rsquo;ve done my
      share! I hope to God I&rsquo;ll forget it some day. Andrew, you know your task.
      Be a man, and get to work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dickinson rose to his feet unsteadily. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What was it? I
      have forgotten, for the moment, but I am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must get his betting book from his pocket,&rdquo; Sir Richard directed.
      &ldquo;Then you must help Merries downstairs with him, and into the car. Merries
      is&mdash;to get rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merries shivered. His hand, too, went out for the brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get rid of him,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It sounds easy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easy,&rdquo; Sir Richard declared. &ldquo;You have only to keep your nerve, and
      the thing is done. No one will see him inside the car, in that motoring
      coat and glasses. You can drive somewhere out into the country and leave
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him!&rdquo; Merries repeated, trembling. &ldquo;Leave him&mdash;yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the two men moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must do more than my share, I suppose,&rdquo; Sir Richard declared
      contemptuously. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dragged the man&rsquo;s body on to a chair, wrapped a huge coat around him,
      tied a motoring cap under his chin, fixed goggles over his eyes. Sir
      Richard strolled into the hall and opened the front door. He stood there
      for a moment, looking up and down the street. When he gave the signal they
      dragged him out, supported between them, across the pavement, into the
      car. Ugh! His attitude was so natural as to be absolutely ghastly. Merries
      started the car and sprang into the driver&rsquo;s seat. There were people in
      the Square now, but the figure reclining in the dark, cushioned interior
      looked perfectly natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long, Jimmy,&rdquo; Sir Richard called out. &ldquo;See you this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right O!&rdquo; Merries replied, with a brave effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff, summoned by telephone from his sitting room, slipped down the
      stairs like a cat&mdash;noiseless, swift. The voice which had summoned him
      had been the voice of his secretary&mdash;a voice almost unrecognisable&mdash;a
      voice shaken with fear. Fear? No, it had been terror!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the landing below, exactly underneath the room from which he had
      descended, there was a door upon which his name was written upon a small
      brass plate&mdash;Mr. Peter Ruff. He opened and closed it behind him with
      a swift movement which he had practised in his idle moments. He found
      himself looking in upon a curious scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown, with the radiance of her hair effectually concealed, in plain
      black skirt and simple blouse&mdash;the ideal secretary&mdash;had risen
      from the seat in front of her typewriter, and was standing facing the door
      through which he had entered, with a small revolver&mdash;which he had
      given her for a birthday present only the day before&mdash;clasped in her
      outstretched hand. The object of her solicitude was, it seemed to Peter
      Ruff, the most pitiful-looking object upon which he had ever looked. The
      hours had dwelt with Merries as the years with some people, and worse. He
      had lost his cap; his hair hung over his forehead in wild confusion; his
      eyes were red, bloodshot, and absolutely aflame with the terrors through
      which he had lived&mdash;underneath them the black marks might have been
      traced with a charcoal pencil. His cheeks were livid save for one burning
      spot. His clothes, too, were in disorder&mdash;the starch had gone from
      his collar, his tie hung loosely outside his waistcoat. He was cowering
      back against the wall. And between him and the girl, stretched upon the
      floor, was the body of a man in a huge motor coat, a limp, inert mass
      which neither moved nor seemed to have any sign of life. No wonder that
      Peter Ruff looked around his office, whose serenity had been so tragically
      disturbed, with an air of mild surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;something seems to have happened! My dear
      Violet, you can put that revolver away. I have secured the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand fell to her side. She gave a little shiver of relief. Peter Ruff
      nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is more comfortable,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Now, perhaps, you will explain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young man,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;or lunatic&mdash;whatever he calls
      himself&mdash;burst in here a few minutes ago, dragging&mdash;that!&rdquo; She
      pointed to the motionless figure upon the floor. &ldquo;If I had not stopped
      him, he would have bolted off without a word of explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff, with his back against the door, shook his head gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lord Merries,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my office is not a mortuary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merries gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know me, then?&rdquo; he muttered, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Ruff answered. &ldquo;It is my profession to know everybody. Go and
      sit down upon that easy-chair, and drink the brandy and soda which Miss
      Brown is about to mix for you. That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merries staggered across the room and half fell into an easy-chair. He
      leaned over the side with his face buried in his hands, unable still to
      face the horror which lay upon the floor. A few seconds later, the tumbler
      of brandy and soda was in his hands. He drank it like a man who drains
      fresh life into his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps now,&rdquo; Peter Ruff suggested, pointing to the motionless figure,
      &ldquo;you can give me some explanation as to this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merries looked away from him all the time he was speaking. His voice was
      thick and nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were three of us lunching together,&rdquo; he began&mdash;&ldquo;four in all.
      There was a dispute, and this man threatened us. Afterwards there was a
      fight. It fell to my lot to take him away, and I can&rsquo;t get rid of him! I
      can&rsquo;t get rid of him!&rdquo; he repeated, with something that sounded like a
      sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still do not see,&rdquo; Peter Ruff argued, &ldquo;why you should have brought him
      here and deposited him upon my perfectly new carpet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Peter Ruff,&rdquo; Merries declared. &ldquo;&lsquo;Crime Investigator and Private
      Detective,&rsquo; you call yourself. You are used to this sort of thing. You
      will know what to do with it. It is part of your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can assure you,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered, &ldquo;that you are under a delusion as
      to the details of my profession. I am Peter Ruff,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;and I
      call myself a crime investigator&mdash;in fact, I am the only one worth
      speaking of in the world. But I certainly deny that I am used to having
      dead bodies deposited upon my carpet, and that I make a habit of disposing
      of them&mdash;especially gratis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merries tore open his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, his voice shaking hysterically, &ldquo;I must get rid of it
      or go mad. For two hours I have been driving about in a motor car with&mdash;it
      for a passenger. I drove to a quiet spot and I tried to lift it out&mdash;a
      policeman rode up! I tried again, a man rushed by on a motor cycle, and
      turned to look at me! I tried a few minutes later&mdash;the policeman came
      back! It was always the same. The night seemed to have eyes. I was watched
      everywhere. The&mdash;the face began to mock me. I&rsquo;ll swear that I heard
      it chuckle once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff moved a little further away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll have anything to do with it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      like your description at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all right with you,&rdquo; Merries declared eagerly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my nerves,
      that&rsquo;s all. You see, I was there&mdash;when the accident happened. See
      here,&rdquo; he added, tearing a pocketbook from his coat, &ldquo;I have three hundred
      and seventy pounds saved up in case I had to bolt. I&rsquo;ll keep seventy&mdash;three
      hundred for you&mdash;to dispose of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruff leaned over the motionless body, looked into its face, and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Masters, the bookmaker,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! I did hear that he had a lot
      of money coming to him over the Cambridgeshire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merries shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I go?&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the three hundred on the table. For God&rsquo;s
      sake, let me go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d saved a little more,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;However&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned the lock and Merries rushed out of the room. Ruff looked across
      the room towards his secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ring up 1535 Central,&rdquo; he ordered, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff had descended from his apartments on the top floor of the
      building, in a new brown suit with which he was violently displeased, to
      meet a caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to intrude&mdash;Mr. Ruff, I believe it is?&rdquo; Sir Richard Dyson
      said, a little irritably&mdash;&ldquo;but I have not a great deal of time to
      spare&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most natural!&rdquo; Peter Ruff declared. &ldquo;Pray take a chair, Sir Richard. You
      want to know, of course, about Lord Merries and poor Masters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard stared at his questioner, for a moment, without speech. Once
      more the fear which he had succeeded in banishing for a while, shone in
      his eyes&mdash;revealed itself in his white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try the easy-chair, Sir Richard,&rdquo; Ruff continued, pleasantly. &ldquo;Leave your
      hat and cane on the table there, and make yourself comfortable. I should
      like to understand exactly what you have come to me for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard moved his head toward Miss Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My business with you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is more than ordinarily private. I have
      the honour of knowing Miss&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Brown,&rdquo; Peter interrupted quickly. &ldquo;In these offices, this young
      lady&rsquo;s name is Miss Violet Brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of no importance,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;only, as you may understand, my
      business with you scarcely requires the presence of a third party, even
      one with the discretion which I am sure Miss&mdash;Brown possesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In these matters,&rdquo; Ruff answered, &ldquo;my secretary does not exist apart from
      myself. Her presence is necessary. She takes down in shorthand notes of
      our conversation. I have a shocking memory, and there are always points
      which I forget. At the conclusion of our business, whatever it may be,
      these notes are destroyed. I could not work without them, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard glanced a little doubtfully at the long, slim back of the girl
      who sat with her face turned away from him. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;if you
      make yourself personally responsible for her discretion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am willing to do so,&rdquo; Ruff interrupted, brusquely. &ldquo;I guarantee it. Go
      on, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, of course, where you got your information from,&rdquo; Sir
      Richard began, &ldquo;but it is perfectly true that I have come here to consult
      you upon a matter in which the two people whose names you have mentioned
      are concerned. The disappearance of Job Masters is, of course, common
      talk; but I cannot tell what has led you to associate with it the
      temporary absence of Lord Merries from this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me ask you this question,&rdquo; Ruff said. &ldquo;How are you affected by the
      disappearance of Masters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indirectly, it has caused me a great deal of inconvenience,&rdquo; Sir Richard
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Facts, please,&rdquo; murmured Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been rumoured,&rdquo; Sir Richard admitted, &ldquo;that I owed Masters a large
      sum of money which I could not pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has also been rumoured,&rdquo; Sir Richard continued, &ldquo;that he was seen to
      enter my house that day, and that he remained there until late in the
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; asked Ruff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Sir Richard answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff yawned for a moment, but covered the indiscretion with his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Respecting this inconvenience,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which you admit that the
      disappearance of Job Masters has caused you, what is its tangible side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard drew his chair a little nearer to the table where Ruff was
      sitting. His voice dropped almost to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems absurd,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and yet, what I tell you is the truth. I have
      been followed about&mdash;shadowed, in fact&mdash;for several days. Men,
      even in my own social circle, seem to hold aloof from me. It is as
      though,&rdquo; he continued slowly, &ldquo;people were beginning to suspect me of
      being connected in some way with the man&rsquo;s disappearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruff, who had been making figures with a pencil on the edge of his
      blotting paper, suddenly turned round. His eyes flashed with a new light
      as they became fixed upon his companion&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you not?&rdquo; he asked, calmly. Sir Richard bore himself well. For a
      moment he had shrunk back. Then he half rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ruff!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must protest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff used no violent gesture. Only his forefinger tapped the desk in
      front of him. His voice was as smooth as velvet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me as much or as little as you please, Sir Richard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
      let that little or that much be the truth! On those terms only I may be
      able to help you. You do not go to your physician and expect him to
      prescribe to you while you conceal your symptoms, or to your lawyer for
      advice and tell him half the truth. I am not asking for your confidence. I
      simply tell you that you are wasting your time and mine if you choose to
      withhold it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard was silent. He recognized a new quality in the man&mdash;but
      the truth was an awful thing to tell! He considered&mdash;then told.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruff briskly asked two questions. &ldquo;In alluding to your heavy settlement
      with Masters, you said just now that you could not have paid him&mdash;then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; Sir Richard admitted. &ldquo;That is the rotten part of the whole
      affair. Four days later a wonderful double came off&mdash;one in which we
      were all interested, and one which not one of us expected. We&rsquo;ve drawn a
      considerable amount already from one or two bookies, and I believe even
      Masters owes us a bit now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Ruff said. &ldquo;I think that I know everything now. My fee is
      five hundred guineas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred guineas,&rdquo; Ruff repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a consultation?&rdquo; Sir Richard asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are a brave man in your way, Sir Richard
      Dyson, but you are going about now shivering under a load of fear. It sits
      like a devil incarnate upon your shoulders. It poisons the air wherever
      you go. Write your cheque, Sir Richard, and you can leave that little
      black devil in my wastebasket. You are under my protection. Nothing will
      happen to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard sat like a man mesmerised. The little man with the amiable
      expression and the badly fitting suit was leaning back in his chair, his
      finger tips pressed together, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing will happen!&rdquo; Sir Richard repeated, incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. I guarantee you against any inconvenience which might
      arise to you from this recent unfortunate affair. Isn&rsquo;t that all you
      want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all I want, certainly,&rdquo; Sir Richard declared, &ldquo;but I must understand
      a little how you propose to secure my immunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my own methods,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can help only those who trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard drew a cheque book from his pocket. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I should
      believe in you,&rdquo; he said, as he wrote the cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, smiling. &ldquo;Fortunately for you, you do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not so easy to impart a similar confidence into the breast of
      Colonel Dickinson, with whom Sir Richard dined that night tete-a-tete.
      Dickinson was inclined to think that Sir Richard ad been &ldquo;had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve paid a ridiculous fee,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;and all that you have in
      return is the fellow&rsquo;s promise to see you through. It isn&rsquo;t like you to
      part with money so easily, Richard. Did he hypnotise you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Sir Richard answered. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t conscious of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a fellow is he?&rdquo; Dickinson asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard looked reflectively into his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a vulgar sort of little Johnny,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Looks as though he were
      always dressed in new clothes and couldn&rsquo;t get used to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three men entered the room. Two remained in the background. John Dory came
      forward towards the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Richard Dyson,&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;I have come upon an unpleasant
      errand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Sir Richard said, fingering something hard inside pocket of his
      coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a warrant for your arrest,&rdquo; Dory continued, &ldquo;in connection with
      the disappearance of Job Masters on Saturday, the 10th of November last. I
      will read the terms of the warrant, if you choose. It is my duty to warn
      you that anything you may now say can be used in evidence against you.
      This gentleman, I believe, is Colonel Dickinson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my name, sir,&rdquo; Dickinson answered, with unexpected fortitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret to say,&rdquo; the detective continued, &ldquo;that I have also a warrant
      for your arrest in connection with the same matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard had hold of the butt end of his revolver then. Like grisly
      phantoms, the thoughts chased one another through his brain. Should he
      shoot and end it&mdash;pass into black nothingness&mdash;escape disgrace,
      but die like a rat in a corner? His finger was upon the trigger. Then
      suddenly his heart gave a great leap. He raised his head as though
      listening. Something flashed in his eyes&mdash;something that was almost
      like hope. There was no mistaking that voice which he had heard in the
      hall! He made a great rally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only conclude,&rdquo; he said, turning to the detective, &ldquo;that you have
      made some absurd blunder. If you really possess the warrants you speak of,
      however, Colonel Dickinson and I will accompany you wherever you choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the door opened and Peter Ruff walked in, followed by Job Masters,
      whose head was still bandaged, and who seemed to have lost a little flesh
      and a lot of colour. Peter Ruff looked round apologetically. He seemed
      surprised not to find Sir Richard Dyson and Colonel Dickinson alone. He
      seemed more than ever surprised to recognize Dory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; he said smoothly, &ldquo;that our visit is not inopportune. Sir
      Richard Dyson, I believe?&rdquo; he continued, bowing&mdash;&ldquo;my friend, Mr.
      Masters here, has consulted me as to the loss of a betting book, and we
      ventured to call to ask you, sir, if by any chance on his recent visit to
      your house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God in Heaven, it&rsquo;s Masters!&rdquo; Dyson exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Job Masters!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me, sir,&rdquo; Masters admitted. &ldquo;Mr. Ruff thought you might be able to
      help me find that book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard swayed upon his feet. Then the blood rushed once more through
      his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your book&rsquo;s here in my cabinet, safe enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You left it here
      after our luncheon that day. Where on earth have you been to, man?&rdquo; he
      continued. &ldquo;We want some money from you over Myopia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay all right, sir,&rdquo; Masters answered. &ldquo;Fact is, after our luncheon
      party I&rsquo;m afraid I got a bit fuddled. I don&rsquo;t seem to remember much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down a little heavily. Peter Ruff hastened to the table and took up
      a glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse me if I give him a little brandy, won&rsquo;t you, sir?&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really not quite fit for getting about yet, but he was
      worrying about his book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him all the brandy he can drink,&rdquo; Sir Richard answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective&rsquo;s face had been a study. He knew Masters well enough by
      sight&mdash;there was no doubt about his identity! His teeth came together
      with an angry little click. He had made a mistake! It was a thing which
      would be remembered against him forever! It was as bad as his failure to
      arrest that young man at Daisy Villa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your visit, Masters,&rdquo; Sir Richard said, with a curious smile at the
      corners of his lips, &ldquo;is, in some respects, a little opportune. About that
      little matter we were speaking of,&rdquo; he continued, turning towards the
      detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have only to offer you our apologies, Sir Richard,&rdquo; Dory answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he crossed the room and confronted Peter Ruff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand, sir, that your name is Ruff&mdash;Peter Ruff?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my name, sir,&rdquo; Peter Ruff admitted, pleasantly &ldquo;Yours I believe,
      is Dory. We are likely to come across one another now and then, I suppose.
      Glad to know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective stood quite still, and there was no geniality in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;have we ever met before?&rdquo; he asked, without removing his
      eyes from the other&rsquo;s face. Peter Ruff smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not professionally, at any rate,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I know that Scotland Yard
      you don&rsquo;t think much of us small fry, but we find out things sometimes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you contradict all those rumours as to his disappearance?&rdquo; the
      detective asked, pointing to where Job Masters was contentedly sipping his
      brandy and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was acting for my client, and in my own interests,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;It
      was surely no part of my duty to save you gentlemen at Scotland Yard from
      hunting up mare&rsquo;s nests!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory went out, followed by his men. Sir Richard took Peter Ruff by
      the arm, and, leading him to the sideboard, mixed him a drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Ruff,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a clever scoundrel, but you&rsquo;ve earned your
      five hundred guineas. Hang it, you&rsquo;re welcome to them! Is there anything
      else I can do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff raised his glass and set it down again. Once more he eyed with
      admiration his client&rsquo;s well-turned out figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might give me a letter to your tailors, Sir Richard,&rdquo; he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard laughed outright&mdash;it was some time since he had laughed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have it, Peter Ruff,&rdquo; he declared, raising his glass&mdash;&ldquo;and
      here&rsquo;s to you!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. VINCENT CAWDOR, COMMISSION AGENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the second time since their new association, Peter Ruff had surprised
      that look upon his secretary&rsquo;s face. This time he wheeled around in his
      chair and addressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;be frank with me. What is wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown turned to face her employer. Save for a greater demureness of
      expression and the extreme simplicity of her attire, she had changed very
      little since she had given up her life of comparative luxury to become
      Peter Ruff&rsquo;s secretary. There was a sort of personal elegance which clung
      to her, notwithstanding her strenuous attempts to dress for her part,
      except for which she looked precisely as a private secretary and typist
      should look. She even wore a black bow at the back of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not complained, have I?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not waste time,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, coldly. &ldquo;Proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not enough to do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do not understand why you refuse
      so many cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not bring my talents into this business,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to watch
      flirting wives, to ascertain the haunts of gay husbands, or to detect the
      pilferings of servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything is better than sitting still,&rdquo; she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not agree with you,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;I like sitting still very
      much indeed&mdash;one has time to think. Is there anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I really go on?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have idea,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that you are subordinating your general
      interests to your secret enmity&mdash;to one man. You are waiting until
      you can find another case in which you are pitted against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;your intelligence surprises me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to you,&rdquo; she continued, looking at him earnestly, &ldquo;for two
      reasons. The personal one I will not touch upon. The other was my love of
      excitement. I have tried many things in life, as you know, Peter, but I
      have seemed to carry always with me the heritage of weariness. I thought
      that my position here would help me to fight against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen me bring a corpse to life,&rdquo; Peter Ruff reminded her, a
      little aggrieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a month ago,&rdquo; she reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that sort of thing every day,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but you have refused four cases within the
      last five days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff whistled softly to himself for several moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen anything of our new neighbour in the flat above?&rdquo; he asked, with
      apparent irrelevance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown looked across at him with upraised eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been in the lift with him twice,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy his appearance?&rdquo; Ruff asked, casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least!&rdquo; Violet answered. &ldquo;I thought him a vulgar, offensive
      person!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff chuckled. He seemed immensely delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vincent Cawdor he calls himself, I believe,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; Miss Brown declared. The subject did not appeal to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is on a small copper plate just over the letter-box,&rdquo; Ruff said.
      &ldquo;Rather neat idea, by the bye. He calls himself a commission agent, I
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Violet was suddenly interested. She realized, after all, that Mr. Vincent
      Cawdor might be a person of some importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a commission agent?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might mean anything,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Never trust any one who is not a
      little more explicit as to his profession. I am afraid that this Mr.
      Vincent Cawdor, for instance, is a bad lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure he is,&rdquo; Miss Brown declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks after a pretty girl, coughs in the lift&mdash;all that sort of
      thing, eh?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgusting!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff sighed, and glanced at the clock. The existence of Mr. Vincent
      Cawdor seemed to pass out of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nearly one o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where do you usually lunch, Violet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends upon my appetite,&rdquo; she answered, carelessly. &ldquo;Most often at an
      A B C.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;you will be extravagant&mdash;at my expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a poor breakfast,&rdquo; Miss Brown remarked, complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will leave at once,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;and you will go to the French
      Cafe at the Milan. Get a table facing the courtyard, and towards the hotel
      side of the room. Keep your eyes open and tell me exactly what you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with parted lips. Her eyes were full of eager
      questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mere skirmishing,&rdquo; Peter Ruff continued, &ldquo;but I think&mdash;yes, I think
      that it may lead to something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom am I to watch?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one who looks interesting,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;For instance, if
      this person Vincent Cawdor should be about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would recognize me!&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must hold the candle,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I decline to flirt with him,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Nothing would induce me to
      be pleasant to such an odious creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be too busy to attempt anything of the sort. Of course he may not
      be there. It may be the merest fancy on my part. At any rate, you may rely
      upon it that he will not make any overtures in a public place like the
      Milan. Mr. Vincent Cawdor may be a curious sort of person, but I do not
      fancy that he is a fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Miss Brown said, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be back soon after three,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;I am going up to my room to
      do my exercises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And afterwards?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have my lunch sent in,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry back, though. I
      shall not expect you till a quarter past three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a few minutes past that time when Miss Brown returned. Peter Ruff
      was sitting at his desk, looking as though he had never moved. He was
      absorbed by a book of patterns sent in by his new tailor, and he only
      glanced up when she entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; he said, earnestly, &ldquo;come in and sit down. I want to consult
      you. There is a new material here&mdash;a sort of mouse-coloured cheviot.
      I wonder whether it would suit me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Violet was looking very handsome and a little flushed. She raised her veil
      and came over to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put that stupid book away, Peter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to tell you about
      the Milan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had forgotten! Was Mr. Vincent Cawdor there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she answered, still a little breathless. &ldquo;There was some one else
      there, too, in whom you are still more interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vincent Cawdor,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;came in alone. He looked just as
      objectionable as ever, and he stared at me till I nearly threw my wine
      glass at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not speak to you?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid that he was going to,&rdquo; Miss Brown said, &ldquo;but fortunately he
      met a friend who came to his table and lunched with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; Ruff remarked. &ldquo;Good! What was he like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair, slight, Teutonic,&rdquo; Miss Brown answered. &ldquo;He wore thick spectacles,
      and his moustache was positively yellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Towards the end of luncheon,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;an American came up to
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An American?&rdquo; Peter Ruff interrupted. &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was clean-shaven and he wore neat clothes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He talked with
      an accent you could have cut with a knife and he had a Baedeker sticking
      out of his pocket. After luncheon, they all three went away to the smoking
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;There was something else&mdash;something which I
      think you will find interesting. At the next table to me there was a man&mdash;alone.
      Can you guess who he was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Dory,&rdquo; Ruff said, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I did not send you there on a fool&rsquo;s errand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something doing, then?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is likely,&rdquo; he answered, grimly, &ldquo;to be a great deal doing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men who stood upon the hill, and Peter Ruff, who lay upon his
      stomach behind a huge boulder, looked upon a new thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far down in the valley from out of a black shed&mdash;the only sign of
      man&rsquo;s handiwork for many miles&mdash;it came&mdash;something grey at
      first, moving slowly as though being pushed down a slight incline, then
      afloat in the air, gathering speed&mdash;something between a torpedo with
      wings and a great prehistoric insect. Now and then it described strange
      circles, but mostly it came towards them as swift and as true as an arrow
      shot from a bow. The two men looked at one another&mdash;the shorter, to
      whose cheeks the Cumberland winds had brought no trace of colour, gave
      vent to a hoarse exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s done it!&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; the other answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over their heads the thing wheeled, and seemed to stand still in the air.
      The beating of the engine was so faint that Peter Ruff from behind the
      boulder, could hear all that was said. A man leaned out from his seat&mdash;a
      man with wan cheeks but blazing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take your glasses. There&mdash;due north&mdash;can you
      see a steeple?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men turned their field glasses in the direction toward which the other
      pointed. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; they answered. &ldquo;It is sixteen miles, as the crow flies, to
      Barnham Church&mdash;thirty-two miles there and back. Wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swung round, dived till he seemed about to touch the hillside, then
      soared upwards and straight away. Peter Ruff took out his watch. The other
      two men gazed with fascinated eyes after the disappearing speck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does it&mdash;&rdquo; the shorter one muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will do it!&rdquo; the other answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was back again before their eyes were weary of watching. Peter Ruff,
      from behind the boulder, closed his watch. Thirty-two miles in less than
      half an hour! The youth leaned from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it enough?&rdquo; he asked, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough!&rdquo; the two men answered together. &ldquo;We will come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth touched a lever and the machine glided down towards the valley,
      falling all the while with the effortless grace a parachute. The shed from
      which his machine had issued was midway down a slope, with a short length
      of rails which ran, apparently, through it. The machine seemed to hover
      for several moments above the building, then descended slowly on to the
      rails and disappeared in the shed. The two men were already half-way down
      the hill. Peter Ruff rose from behind the boulder, stretched himself with
      a sense of immense relief, and lit a pipe. As yet he dared not descend. He
      simply changed his hiding place for a spot which enabled him to command a
      view of the handful of cottages at the back of the hill. He had plenty to
      think about. It was a wonderful thing&mdash;this&mdash;which he had seen!
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth, meanwhile, was drinking deep of the poisonous cup. He walked
      between the two men&mdash;his cheeks were flushed, his eyes on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If all the world to-day had seen what we have seen,&rdquo; the older man was
      saying, &ldquo;there would be no more talk of Wilbur Wrights or Farmans. Those
      men are babies, playing with their toys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine is the ideal principle,&rdquo; the youth declared. &ldquo;No one else has
      thought of it, no one else has made use of it. Yet all the time I am
      afraid&mdash;it is so simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sell quick, then,&rdquo; the fair-headed man advised. &ldquo;By to-morrow night I can
      promise you fifty thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth stopped. He drew a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall sell,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I need money. I want to live. Fifty thousand
      pounds is enough. Eleven weary months I have slept and toiled there in the
      shed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is finished,&rdquo; the older man declared. &ldquo;To-night you shall come with us
      to London. To-morrow night your pockets shall be full of gold. It will be
      a change for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows it will,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t two shillings in the world,
      and I owe for my last petrol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men laughed heartily. The elder took a little bundle of notes from
      his pocket and handed them to the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not for another moment shall you feel as poor as that.
      Money will have no value for you in the future. The fifty thousand pounds
      will only be a start. After that, you will get royalties. If I had it, I
      would give you a quarter of a million now for your plans; I know that I
      can get you more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth laughed hysterically. They entered the tiny inn and drank
      home-made wine&mdash;the best they could get. Then a great car drew up
      outside, and the older&mdash;the clean-shaven man, who looked like an
      American&mdash;hurried out, and dragging a hamper from beneath the seat
      returned with a gold-foiled bottle in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a toast! We have one bottle left&mdash;one bottle of the
      best!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Champagne!&rdquo; the youth cried eagerly, holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only wine for the conquerors,&rdquo; the other declared, pouring it out
      into the thick tumblers. &ldquo;Drink, all of you, to the Franklin Flying
      Machine, to the millions she will earn&mdash;to to-morrow night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth drained his glass, watched it replenished, and drained it again.
      Then they went out to the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing yet to be done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Wait here for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They waited whilst he climbed up toward the shed. The two men watched him.
      A little group of rustics stood open-mouthed around the great car. Then
      there was a little shout. From above their heads came the sound of a great
      explosion&mdash;red flames were leaping up from that black barn to the
      sky. The two men looked at one another. They rushed to the hill and met
      the youth descending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dared not leave it here,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It would have been madness. I
      am perfectly certain that I have been watched during the last few days. I
      can build another in a week. I have the plans in my pocket for every
      part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The older man wiped the perspiration from his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure&mdash;that you have the plans?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth struck himself on the chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are here,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;every one of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right, then,&rdquo; the other man answered. &ldquo;It gave me a turn,
      though. You are sure that you can make it again in the time you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; the youth answered, impatiently. &ldquo;Besides, the thing is so
      simple. It speaks for itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They climbed into the car, and in a few minutes were rushing away
      southwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow night&mdash;to-morrow night it all begins!&rdquo; the youth
      continued. &ldquo;I must start with ready-made clothes. I&rsquo;ll get the best I can,
      eat the best I can, drink wine, go to the music halls. To-morrow night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His speech ended in a wail&mdash;a strange, half-stifled cry which rang
      out with a chill, ghostly sound upon the black silence. His face was
      covered with a wet towel, a ghastly odor was in his nostrils, his lips
      refused to utter any further sound. He lay back among the cushions,
      senseless. The car slowed down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get the papers, quick!&rdquo; the elder man muttered, opening the youth&rsquo;s coat.
      &ldquo;Here they are! Catch hold, Dick! My God! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook from head to foot. The little fair man looked at him with
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sheep bell on the moor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Are you sure you have everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; the other muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both stood up and raised the prostrate form between them. Below them
      were the black waters of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over with him!&rdquo; the younger said. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more his companion shrank away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he muttered, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both held their breaths. From somewhere along the road behind came a
      faint sound like the beating of an engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a car!&rdquo; the elder man exclaimed. &ldquo;Quick! Over with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They lifted the body of the boy, whose lips were white and speechless now,
      and threw him into the water. With a great splash he disappeared. They
      watched for a moment. Only the ripples flowed away from the place where he
      had sunk. They jumped back to their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something close behind,&rdquo; the older man muttered. &ldquo;Get on! Fast!
      Fast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger man hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;it would be better to wait and see who it is
      coming up behind. Our young friend there is safe. The current has him, and
      the tarn is bottomless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s indecision&mdash;a moment which was to count for much
      in the lives of three men. Then the elder one&rsquo;s counsels prevailed. They
      crept away down the hill, smoothly and noiselessly. Behind them, the faint
      throbbing grew less and less distinct. Soon they heard it no more. They
      drove into the dawn and through the long day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Side by side on one of the big leather couches in the small smoking room
      of the Milan Hotel, Mr. James P. Rounceby and his friend Mr. Richard
      Marnstam sat whispering together. It was nearly two o clock, and they were
      alone in the room. Some of the lights had been turned out. The roar of
      life in the streets without had ceased. It was an uneasy hour for those
      whose consciences were not wholly at rest!
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men were in evening dress&mdash;Rounceby in dinner coat and black
      tie, as befitted his role of travelling American. The glasses in front of
      them were only half-filled, and had remained so for the last hour. Their
      conversation had been nervous and spasmodic. It was obvious that they were
      waiting for some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three o&rsquo;clock struck by the little timepiece on the mantel shelf. A little
      exclamation of a profane nature broke from Rounceby&rsquo;s lips. He leaned
      toward his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he muttered, in a rather thick undertone, &ldquo;how about this fellow
      Vincent Cawdor? You haven&rsquo;t any doubts about him, I suppose? He&rsquo;s on the
      square, all right, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marnstam wet his lips nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cawdor&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had it direct from headquarters at
      Paris. What are you uneasy about, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rounceby pointed towards the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see the time?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he&rsquo;d be late,&rdquo; Marnstam answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rounceby put his hand to his forehead and found it moist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a silly game, all along,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better have
      brought the young ass up here and jostled him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so easy,&rdquo; Marnstam answered. &ldquo;These young fools have a way of turning
      obstinate. He&rsquo;d have chucked us, sure. Anyhow, he&rsquo;s safer where he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They relapsed once more into silence. A storm of rain beat upon the
      window. Rounceby glanced up. It was as black out there as were the waters
      of that silent tarn! The man shivered as the thought struck him. Marnstam,
      who had no nerves, twirled his moustache and watched his companion with
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look as though you saw a ghost,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I do!&rdquo; Rounceby growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better finish your drink, my dear fellow,&rdquo; Marnstam advised.
      &ldquo;Afterwards&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he stiffened into attention. He laid his hand upon his
      companion&rsquo;s knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is some one coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They leaned a little forward. The swing doors were opened. A girl&rsquo;s
      musical laugh rang out from the corridor. Tall and elegant, with her black
      lace skirt trailing upon the floor, her left hand resting upon the
      shoulder of the man into whose ear she was whispering, and whom she led
      straight to one of the writing tables, Miss Violet Brown swept into the
      room. On her right, and nearest to the two men, was Mr. Vincent Cawdor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you can go and talk to your friends!&rdquo; she exclaimed, lightly. &ldquo;I am
      going to make Victor listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cawdor left his two companions and sank on to the couch by Rounceby&rsquo;s
      side. The young man, with his opera hat still on his head, and the light
      overcoat which he had been carrying on the floor by his side, was seated
      before the writing table with his back to them. Miss Brown was leaning
      over him, with her hand upon the back of his chair. They were out of
      hearing of the other three men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Rounceby, my friend,&rdquo; Mr. Vincent Cawdor remarked, cheerfully,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;re having a late sitting, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been waiting for you, you fool!&rdquo; Rounceby answered. &ldquo;What on earth
      are you thinking about, bringing a crowd like this about with you, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cawdor smiled, reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry,&rdquo; he said, in a lower tone. &ldquo;I know my way in and out of
      the ropes here better than you can teach me. A big hotel like this is the
      safest and the most dangerous place in the world&mdash;just how you choose
      to make it. You&rsquo;ve got to bluff &lsquo;em all the time. That&rsquo;s why I brought the
      young lady&mdash;particular friend of mine&mdash;real nice girl, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the young man?&rdquo; Rounceby asked, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cawdor grew more serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Captain Lowther,&rdquo; he said softly&mdash;&ldquo;private secretary to
      Colonel Dean, who&rsquo;s the chief of the aeronaut department at Aldershot. He
      has a draft in his pocket for twenty thousand pounds. It is yours if he is
      satisfied with the plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty thousand pounds!&rdquo; Marnstam said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;It is very little&mdash;very
      little indeed for the risks which we have run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cawdor moved his place and sat between the men. He laid a hand upon
      Marnstam&rsquo;s shoulder&mdash;another on Rounceby&rsquo;s knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friends,&rdquo; he said, impressively, &ldquo;if you could have built a
      model, or conducted these negotiations in the usual way, you might have
      asked a million. As it is, I think I am the only man in England who could
      have dealt with this matter&mdash;so satisfactorily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rounceby glanced suspiciously at the young man to whom Miss Brown was
      still devoting the whole of her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t he come out and talk like a man?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea of
      his sitting over there with his back to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want him never to see your faces&mdash;to deal only with me,&rdquo; Cawdor
      explained. &ldquo;Remember that he is in an official position. The money he is
      going to part with is secret service money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men were beginning to be more reassured. Rounceby slowly produced
      a roll of oilskin from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll look at them as he sits there,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;There must be no
      copying or making notes, mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cawdor smiled in a superior fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are dealing with the emissary of a
      government&mdash;not one of your own sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rounceby glanced at his companion, who nodded. Then he handed over the
      plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him to look sharp,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so late but that there may be
      people in here yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cawdor crossed the room with the plans, and laid them down before the
      writing table. Rounceby rose to his feet and lit a cigar. Marnstam walked
      to the further window and back again. They stood side by side. Rounceby&rsquo;s
      whole frame seemed to have stiffened with some new emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong, Jim,&rdquo; Marnstam whispered softly in his ear.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the old lady in your pocket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Rounceby answered thickly, &ldquo;and, by Heavens, I&rsquo;m going to use it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot unless it&rsquo;s the worst,&rdquo; Marnstam counselled. &ldquo;I shall go out
      of that window, into the tree, and run for the river. But bluff first, Jim&mdash;bluff
      for your life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were swinging doors leading into the room from the hotel side, and a
      small door exactly opposite which led to the residential part of the
      place. Both of these doors were opened at precisely the same moment.
      Through the former stepped two strong looking men in long overcoats, and
      with the unmistakable appearance of policemen in plain clothes. Through
      the latter came John Dory! He walked straight up to the two men. It spoke
      volumes for his courage that, knowing their characters and believing them
      to be in desperate straits, he came unarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hold warrants for your arrest. I will not trouble
      you with your aliases. You are known to-day, I believe, as James Rounceby
      and Richard Marnstam. Will you come quietly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marnstam&rsquo;s expression was one of bland and beautiful surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he said, edging, however, a little toward the window&mdash;&ldquo;you
      must be joking! What is the charge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are charged with the wilful murder of a young man named Victor
      Franklin,&rdquo; answered Dory. &ldquo;His body was recovered from Longthorp Tarn this
      afternoon. You had better say nothing. Also with the theft of certain
      papers known to have been in his possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now it is possible that at this precise moment Marnstam would have made
      his spring for the window and Rounceby his running fight for liberty. The
      hands of both men were upon their revolvers, and John Dory&rsquo;s life was a
      thing of no account. But at this juncture a thing happened. There were in
      the room the two policemen guarding the swing doors, and behind them the
      pale faces of a couple of night porters looking anxiously in. Vincent
      Cawdor and Miss Brown were standing side by side, a little in the
      background, and the young man who had been their companion had risen also
      to his feet. As though with some intention of intervening, he moved a step
      forward, almost in line with Dory. Rounceby saw him, and a new fear
      gripped him by the heart. He shrank back, his fingers relaxed their hold
      of his weapon, the sweat was hot upon his forehead. Marnstam, though he
      seemed for a moment stupefied, realised the miracle which had happened and
      struck boldly for his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this is a joke,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it strikes me as being a particularly bad
      one. I should like to know, sir, how you dare to come into this room and
      charge me and my friend&mdash;Mr. Rounceby&mdash;with being concerned in
      the murder of a young man who is even now actually standing by your side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory started back. He looked with something like apprehension at the
      youth to whom Marnstam pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Victor Franklin,&rdquo; that young man declared. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this
      about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dory felt the ground give beneath his feet. Nevertheless, he set his teeth
      and fought for his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that your name is Victor Franklin?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the inventor of a flying machine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were in Westmoreland with these two men a few days go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; the young man admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You left the village of Scawton in a motor car with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! We quarrelled on the way, and parted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were robbed of nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victor Franklin smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I had nothing worth stealing except my
      plans, and they are in my pocket now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a few moments&rsquo; intense silence. Dory wheeled suddenly round, and
      looked to where Mr. Vincent Cawdor had been standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mr. Cawdor?&rdquo; he asked, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman with the grey moustache left a few seconds ago,&rdquo; one of the
      men at the door said. Dory was very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have to offer you my apologies. I have apparently
      been deceived by some false information. The charge is withdrawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned on his heel and left the room. The two policemen followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep them under observation,&rdquo; Dory ordered shortly, &ldquo;but I am afraid this
      fellow Cawdor has sold me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found a hansom outside, and sprang into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number 27, Southampton Row,&rdquo; he ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rounceby and his partner were alone in the little smoking room. The former
      was almost inarticulate. The night porter brought them brandy, and both
      men drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get to the bottom of this, Marnstam,&rdquo; Mr. Rounceby muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marnstam was thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember that sound through the darkness,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;the
      beating of an engine way back on the road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; Rounceby demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a motor bicycle,&rdquo; Marnstam said quietly. &ldquo;I thought so at the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing some one followed us and pulled him out,&rdquo; Rounceby said,
      hoarsely, &ldquo;why are we treated like this? I tell you we&rsquo;ve been made fools
      of! We&rsquo;ve been treated like children&mdash;not even to be punished! We&rsquo;ll
      have the truth somehow out of that devil Cawdor! Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They made their way to the courtyard and found a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number 27, Southampton Row!&rdquo; they ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached their destination some time before Dory, whose horse fell
      down in the Strand, and who had to walk. They ascended to the fourth floor
      of the building and rang the bell of Vincent Cawdor&rsquo;s room&mdash;no
      answer. They plied the knocker&mdash;no result. Rounceby peered through
      the keyhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t come home yet,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;There is no light anywhere in the
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of a flat across the passage was quietly opened. Mr. Peter Ruff,
      in a neat black smoking suit and slippers, and holding a pipe in his hand,
      looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I do not think that Mr. Cawdor is
      in. He went out early this evening, and I have not heard him return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are much obliged to you, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Marnstam said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I give him any message?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked, politely. &ldquo;We generally
      see something of one another in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell him&mdash;&rdquo; Rounceby began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No message, thanks!&rdquo; Marnstam interrupted. &ldquo;We shall probably run across
      him ourselves to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory was nearly a quarter of an hour late. After his third useless
      summons, Mr. Peter Ruff presented himself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will not find my neighbour at home. There
      have been several people enquiring for him to-night, without any result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory came slowly across the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Ruff!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Mr. Dory!&rdquo; Peter Ruff declared. &ldquo;Come in, do, and have a
      drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory accepted the invitation, and his eyes were busy in that little
      sitting room during the few minutes which it took his host to mix that
      whisky and soda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing wrong with our friend opposite, I hope?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked,
      jerking his head across the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, Mr. Ruff,&rdquo; John Dory said. &ldquo;No doubt in the morning he will
      be able to explain everything. I must say that I should like to see him
      to-night, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may turn up yet,&rdquo; Peter Ruff remarked, cheerfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like myself&mdash;a
      late bird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; Dory answered, drily. &ldquo;Nice rooms you have here, sir. Just a
      sitting room and bedroom, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff stood up and threw open the door of the inner apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Care to have a look round?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective did look round, and pretty thoroughly. As soon as he was
      sure that there was no one concealed upon the premises, he drank his
      whisky and soda and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look in again to see Cawdor,&rdquo; he remarked&mdash;&ldquo;to-morrow, perhaps,
      or the next day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let him know if I see him about,&rdquo; Peter Ruff declared. &ldquo;Sorry the
      lift&rsquo;s stopped. Three steps to the left and straight on. Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown arrived early the following morning, and was disposed to be
      inquisitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;exactly what has become of Mr. Vincent
      Cawdor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff took her upstairs. There was a little mound of ashes in the
      grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagined that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But why did you send me out to watch
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Violet,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered, &ldquo;there is no man in the world
      to-day who is my equal in the art of disguising himself. At the same time,
      I wanted to know whether I could deceive you. I wanted to be quite sure
      that my study of Mr. Vincent Cawdor was a safe one. I took those rooms in
      his name and in his own person. I do not think that it occurred even to
      our friend John Dory to connect us in his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Now tell me, please, what took you up to
      Westmoreland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I followed Rounceby and Marnstam,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I knew them when I was
      abroad, studying crime&mdash;I could tell you a good deal about both those
      men if it were worth while&mdash;and I knew, when they hired a big motor
      car and engaged a crook to drive it, that they were worth following. I saw
      the trial of the flying machine, and when they started off with young
      Franklin, I followed on a motor bicycle. I fished him out of the tarn
      where they left him for dead, brought him on to London, and made my own
      terms with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the body which was found in the Longthorp Tarn?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had that telegram sent myself,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went out of your way to make a fool of John Dory!&rdquo; she said, frowning
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I admit,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that that, after all, has been the chief
      object of the whole affair. I do not see that we&mdash;that is the firm&mdash;profit
      in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a fourth share in the Franklin Flying Machine,&rdquo; he answered,
      &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m hanged if I&rsquo;d sell it for a hundred thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken advantage of that young man&rsquo;s gratitude,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I earned the money,&rdquo; he answered.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE INDISCRETION OF LETTY SHAW
    </h2>
    <p>
      Amidst a storm of whispered criticisms, the general opinion was that Letty
      Shaw was a silly little fool who ought to have known better. When she had
      entered the restaurant a few minutes before midnight, followed by Austen
      Abbott, every one looked to see a third person following them. No third
      person, however, appeared. Gustav himself conducted them to a small table
      laid for two, covered with pink roses, and handed his fair client the menu
      of a specially ordered supper. There was no gainsaying the fact that Letty
      and her escort proposed supping alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cafe at the Milan was, without doubt, the fashionable rendezvous of
      the moment for those ladies connected with the stage who, after their
      performance, had not the time or the inclination to make the conventional
      toilet demanded by the larger restaurants. Letty Shaw, being one of the
      principal ornaments of the musical comedy stage, was well known to every
      one in the room. There was scarcely a person there who within the last
      fortnight had not found an opportunity of congratulating her upon her
      engagement to Captain the Honourable Brian Sotherst. Sotherst was rich,
      and one of the most popular young men about town. Letty Shaw, although she
      had had one or two harmless flirtations, was well known as a
      self-respecting and hard-working young actress who loved her work, and
      against whom no one had ever had a word to say. Consequently, the shock
      was all the greater when, within a fortnight of her engagement, she was
      thus to be seen openly supping alone with the most notorious woman hunter
      about town&mdash;a man of bad reputation, a man, too, towards whom
      Sotherst was known to have a special aversion. Nothing but a break with
      Sotherst or a fit of temporary insanity seemed to explain, even
      inadequately, the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her best friend&mdash;the friend who knew her and believed in her&mdash;rose
      to her feet and came sailing down the room. She nodded gaily to Abbott,
      whom she hated, and whom she had not recognized for years, and laid her
      hand upon Letty&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Brian?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty shrugged her shoulders&mdash;it was not altogether a natural
      gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On duty to-night,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her best friend paused for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come over and join our party, both of you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Dicky Pennell&rsquo;s
      here and Gracie Marsh&mdash;just landed. They&rsquo;d love to meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Letty shook her head slowly. There was a look in her face which even her
      best friend did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that we can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am Mr. Abbott&rsquo;s guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to-night,&rdquo; Austen Abbott intervened, looking up at the woman who
      stood between them, &ldquo;I am not disposed to share Miss Shaw with anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her best friend could do no more than shake her head and go away. The two
      were left alone for the rest of the evening. When they departed together,
      people who knew felt that a whiff of tragedy had passed through the room.
      Nobody understood&mdash;or pretended to understand. Even before her
      engagement, Letty had never been known to sup alone with a man. That she
      should do so now, and with this particular man, was preposterous!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something will come of it,&rdquo; her best friend murmured, sadly, as she
      watched Austen Abbott help his companion on with her cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something did!
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff rose at his accustomed time the following morning, and attired
      himself, if possible, with more than his usual care. He wore the grey suit
      which he had carefully put out the night before, but he hesitated long
      between the rival appeals of a red tie with white spots and a plain mauve
      one. He finally chose the latter, finding that it harmonised more
      satisfactorily with his socks, and after a final survey of himself in the
      looking-glass, he entered the next room, where his coffee was set out upon
      a small round table near the fire, together with his letters and
      newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff was, after all, like the rest of us, a creature of habit. He
      made an invariable rule of glancing through the newspapers before he paid
      any regard at all to his letters or his breakfast. In the absence of
      anything of a particularly sensational character, he then opened his
      letters in leisurely fashion, and went back afterwards to the newspaper as
      he finished his meal. This morning, however, both his breakfast and
      letters remained for some time untouched. The first paragraph which caught
      his eye as he shook open the Daily Telegraph was sufficiently absorbing.
      There it was in great black type:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      TERRIBLE TRAGEDY IN THE FLAT OF A WELL-KNOWN ACTRESS!
                   AUSTEN ABBOTT SHOT DEAD!
                  ARREST OF CAPTAIN SOTHERST
</pre>
    <p>
      Beyond the inevitable shock which is always associated with the taking of
      life, and the unusual position of the people concerned in it, there was
      little in the brief account of the incident to excite the imagination. A
      policeman on the pavement outside the flat in which Miss Shaw and her
      mother lived fancied that he heard, about two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the
      report of a revolver shot. As nothing further transpired, and as the sound
      was very indistinct, he did not at once enter the building, but kept it,
      so far as possible, under observation. About twenty minutes later, a young
      gentleman in evening dress came out into the street, and the policeman
      noticed at once that he was carrying a small revolver, which he attempted
      to conceal. The constable thereupon whistled for his sergeant, and
      accompanied by the young gentleman&mdash;who made no effort to escape&mdash;ascended
      to Miss Shaw&rsquo;s rooms, where the body of Austen Abbott was discovered lying
      upon the threshold of the sitting room with a small bullet mark through
      the forehead. The inmates of the house were aroused and a doctor sent for.
      The deceased man was identified as Austen Abbott&mdash;a well-known actor&mdash;and
      the man under arrest gave his name at once as Captain the Honourable Brian
      Sotherst. Peter Ruff sighed as he laid down the paper. The case seemed to
      him perfectly clear, and his sympathies were altogether with the young
      officer who had taken the law into his own hands. He knew nothing of Miss
      Letty Shaw, and, consequently, did her, perhaps, less than justice in his
      thoughts. Of Austen Abbott, on the other hand, he knew a great deal&mdash;and
      nothing of good. It was absurd, after all, that any one should be punished
      for killing such a brute!
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended, a few minutes later, to his office, and found Miss Brown
      busy arranging a bowl of violets upon his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it horrible?&rdquo; she cried, as he entered, carrying a bundle of papers
      under his arm. &ldquo;I never have had such a shock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know any of them, then?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked, straightening his tie
      in the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Why, I was in the same company as Letty Shaw
      for a year. I was at the Milan, too, last night. Letty was there having
      supper alone with Austen Abbott. We all said that there&rsquo;d be trouble, but
      of course we never dreamed of this! Isn&rsquo;t there any chance for him, Peter?
      Can&rsquo;t he get off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;They may be able to bring evidence of a
      quarrel and reduce it to manslaughter, but what you&rsquo;ve just told me about
      this supper party makes it all the worse. It will come out in the
      evidence, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Sotherst is such a dear,&rdquo; Miss Brown declared, &ldquo;and so
      good-looking! And as for that brute Austen Abbott, he ought to have been
      shot long ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff seated himself before his desk and hitched up his trousers at
      the knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt you are right, Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but people go about these
      things so foolishly. To me it is simply exasperating to reflect how little
      use is made of persons such as myself, whose profession in life it is to
      arrange these little matters. Take the present case, for example. Captain
      Sotherst had only to lay these facts before me, and Austen Abbott was a
      ruined man. I could have arranged the affair for him in half-a-dozen
      different ways. Whereas now it must be a life for a life&mdash;the life of
      an honest young English gentleman for that of a creature who should have
      been kicked out of the world as vermin!... I have some letters give you,
      Violet, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swung round in her chair reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking of that poor young fellow,&rdquo; she said, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sentiment after office hours, if you please!&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there came a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      His visitor lifted her veil, and Peter Ruff recognized her immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you, Lady Mary?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the recognition in his eyes even before he spoke, and wondered at
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know me?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know most people,&rdquo; he answered, drily; &ldquo;it is part of my profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me&mdash;you are Mr. Peter Ruff,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the famous specialist
      in the detection of crime? You know that Brian Sotherst is my brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know it! I am sorry&mdash;very sorry, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed her a chair. She seated herself with a little tightening of the
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want more than sympathy from you, Mr. Ruff,&rdquo; she warned him. &ldquo;I want
      your help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my profession,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but your brother&rsquo;s case makes
      intervention difficult, does it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother himself does not deny his guilt, I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not denied it,&rdquo; she answered&mdash;&ldquo;very likely he will not do so
      before the magistrate&mdash;but neither has he admitted it. Mr. Ruff, you
      are such a clever man. Can&rsquo;t you see the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff looked at her steadily for several moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Mary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can see what you are going to suggest. You are
      going on the assumption that Austen Abbott was shot by Letty Shaw and that
      your brother is taking the thing on his shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;The girl did it herself, beyond a doubt.
      Brian would never have shot any one. He might have horsewhipped him,
      perhaps&mdash;even beaten him to death&mdash;but shot him in cold blood&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The provocation&mdash;&rdquo; Ruff began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no provocation,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;He was engaged to the girl,
      and of course we hated it, but she was an honest little thing, and devoted
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; Ruff admitted. &ldquo;But all the same, as you will hear before the
      magistrates, or at the inquest, she was having supper alone with Austen
      Abbott that night at the Milan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary&rsquo;s eyes flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nevertheless true,&rdquo; Peter Ruff assured her. &ldquo;There is no shadow of
      doubt about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary was staggered. For a few moment she seemed struggling to
      rearrange her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Ruff continued, &ldquo;the fact that Miss Shaw was willing to sup
      with Austen Abbott tete-a-tete renders it more improbable that she should
      shoot him in her sitting room, an hour or so later, and then go calmly up
      to her mother&rsquo;s room as though nothing had happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary had lost some of her confidence, but she was not daunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if we have been deceived in the girl,&rdquo; she said, thoughtfully&mdash;&ldquo;even
      if she were disposed to flirt with other men&mdash;even then there might
      be a stronger motive than ever for her wishing to get rid of Abbott. He
      may have become jealous, and threatened her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, of course, possible,&rdquo; Ruff assented, politely. &ldquo;Your theory would,
      at any rate, account for your brother&rsquo;s present attitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe, then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that my brother shot Austen Abbott?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he admitted frankly. &ldquo;So does every man or woman of common sense
      in London. On the facts as they are stated in the newspapers, with the
      addition of which I have told you, no other conclusion is possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may as well go,&rdquo; she said tearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Peter Ruff declared. &ldquo;Listen. This is a matter of business
      with me. I say that on the facts as they are known, your brother&rsquo;s guilt
      appears indubitable. I do not say that there may not be other facts in the
      background which alter the state of affairs. If you wish me to search for
      them, engage me, and I will do my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what I am here for?&rdquo; the girl exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;My services are at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do your best&mdash;more than your best, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she begged.
      &ldquo;Remember that he is my brother&mdash;my favourite brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do what can be done,&rdquo; Peter Ruff promised. &ldquo;Please sit down at
      that desk and write me two letters of introduction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew off her gloves and prepared to obey him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the solicitors who are defending your brother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and to Miss
      Letty Shaw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to go and see her?&rdquo; Lady Mary asked, doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;If your supposition is correct, she
      might easily give herself away under a little subtle cross-examination. It
      is my business to know how to ask people questions in such a way that if
      they do not speak the truth their words give some indication of it. If she
      is innocent I shall know that I have to make my effort in another
      direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other direction can there be?&rdquo; Lady Mary asked dismally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff said nothing. He was too kind-hearted to kindle false hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hopeless case, of course,&rdquo; Miss Brown remarked, after Lady Mary
      had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;Still I must earn my money. Please
      get some one to take you to supper to-night at the Milan, and see if you
      can pick up any scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Letty?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About either of them,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Particularly I should like to know
      if any explanation has cropped up of her supping alone with Austen
      Abbott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you can&rsquo;t take me yourself,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;You are on
      the side of the law this time, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he answered, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;I will call for you
      at eleven o&rsquo;clock to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and closed his desk emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going out?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to see Miss Letty Shaw,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a taxicab to the flats, and found a handful of curious people
      still gazing up at the third floor. The parlourmaid who answered his
      summons was absolutely certain that Miss Shaw would not see him. He
      persuaded her, after some difficulty, to take in his letter while he
      waited in the hall. When she returned, she showed him into a small sitting
      room and pulled down the blinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Shaw will see you, sir, for a few minutes,&rdquo; she announced, in a
      subdued tone. &ldquo;Poor dear young lady,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;she has been crying
      her eyes out all the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, sympathetically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible business,
      this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the nicest young men as ever walked,&rdquo; the girl declared, firmly.
      &ldquo;As for that brute, he deserved all he&rsquo;s got, and more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff was left alone for nearly a quarter of an hour. Then the door
      was softly opened and Letty Shaw entered. There was no doubt whatever
      about her suffering. Ruff, who had seen her only lately at the theatre,
      was shocked. Under her eyes were blacker lines than her pencil had ever
      traced. Not only was she ghastly pale, but her face seemed wan and
      shrunken. She spoke to him the moment she entered, leaning with on hand
      upon the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Mary writes that you want to help us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How can you? How
      is it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even her voice had gone. She spoke hoarsely, and as though short of
      breath. Her eyes searched his face feverishly. It seemed cruelty not to
      answer her at once, and Peter Ruff was not a cruel man. Nevertheless, he
      remained silent, and it seemed to her that his eyes were like points of
      fire upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she cried, with breaking voice. &ldquo;What have you come
      for? Why don&rsquo;t you speak to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;I should like to help you, and I will do what I
      can. But in order that I may do so, it is necessary that you should answer
      me two questions&mdash;truthfully!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes grew wider. It was the face of a terrified child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What have I to conceal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff&rsquo;s expression never changed. There was nothing about him, as he
      stood there with his hands behind him, his head thrown a little forward,
      in the least inspiring&mdash;nothing calculated to terrify the most timid
      person. Yet the girl looked at him with the eyes of a frightened bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, then,&rdquo; he continued, smoothly, &ldquo;that what you say to me is
      sacred. You and I are alone without witnesses or eavesdroppers. Was it
      Brian Sotherst who shot Abbott&mdash;or was it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little cry. Her hands clasped the sides of her head in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I! God help me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited. In a moment she looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot believe that,&rdquo; she said, with a calmness for which he was
      scarcely prepared. &ldquo;It is absurd. I left the room by the inner door as he
      took up his hat to step out into the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incidentally,&rdquo; he asked&mdash;&ldquo;this is not my other question, mind&mdash;why
      did you not let him out yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had disagreed,&rdquo; she answered, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff bent his head in assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;You had disagreed. Abbott probably hoped that you
      would relent, so he waited for a few minutes. Brian Sotherst, who had
      escaped from his engagement in time, he thought, to come and wish you good
      night, must have walked in and found him there. By the bye, how would
      Captain Sotherst get in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a key,&rdquo; the girl answered. &ldquo;My mother lives here with me, and we
      have only one maid. It was more convenient. I gave him one washed in gold
      for a birthday present only a few days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;The revolver, I understand, was your
      property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a present from Brian,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He gave it to me in a joke, and
      I had it on the table with some other curiosities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first question,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;is disposed of. May I proceed to
      the second?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl moistened her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you sup alone with Austen Abbott last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrank a little away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I not?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been on the stage, my dear Miss Shaw,&rdquo; Peter Ruff continued,
      &ldquo;for between four and five years. During the whole of that time, it has
      been your very wise habit to join supper parties, of course, when the
      company was agreeable to you, but to sup alone with no man! Am I not
      right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know a great deal about me,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not right?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You break your rule for the first time,&rdquo; Peter Ruff continued, &ldquo;in favour
      of a man of notoriously bad character, a few weeks after the announcement
      of your engagement to an honourable young English gentleman. You know very
      well the construction likely to be put upon your behaviour&mdash;you, of
      all people, would be the most likely to appreciate the risk you ran. Why
      did you run it? In other words, I repeat my question. Why did you sup
      alone with Austen Abbott last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this time she had been standing. She came a little forward now, and
      threw herself into an easy-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t help!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;All this doesn&rsquo;t help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor can I help you, then,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, stretching out his hand for
      his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waved to him to put it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It has nothing to do with the case, but
      since you ask, you shall know. There is a dear little girl in our company&mdash;Fluffy
      Dean we all call her&mdash;only eighteen years old. We all love her, she
      is so sweet, and just like I was when I first went on the stage, only much
      nicer. She is very pretty, she has no money, and she is such an
      affectionate little dear that although she is as good as gold, we are all
      terrified for her sake whenever she makes acquaintances. Several of us who
      are most interested made a sort of covenant. We all took it in turns to
      look after her, and try to see that she did not meet any one she
      shouldn&rsquo;t. Yet, for all our precautions, Austen Abbott got hold of her and
      turned her silly little head. He was a man of experience, and she was only
      a child. She wouldn&rsquo;t listen to us&mdash;she wouldn&rsquo;t hear a word against
      him. I took what seemed to me to be the only chance. I went to him myself&mdash;I
      begged for mercy, I begged him to spare the child. I swore that if&mdash;anything
      happened to her, I would start a crusade against him, I would pledge my
      word that he should be cut by every decent man and woman on the stage! He
      listened to what I had to say and at first he only smiled. When I had
      finished, he made me an offer. He said that if I would sup with him alone
      at the Milan, and permit him to escort me home afterwards, he would spare
      the child. One further condition he made&mdash;that I was to tell no one
      why I did it. It was the man&rsquo;s brutal vanity! I made the promise, but I
      break it now. You have asked me and I have told you. I went through with
      the supper, although I hated it. I let him come in for a drink as though
      he had been a friend. Then he tried to make love to me. I took the
      opportunity of telling him exactly what I thought of him. Then I showed
      him the door, and left him. Afterwards&mdash;afterwards&mdash;Brian came
      in! They must have met upon the very threshold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff took up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she continued, drearily, &ldquo;that it all has very little to do
      with the case. I meant to keep it to myself, because, of course, apart
      from anything else, apart from Brian&rsquo;s meeting him coming out of my rooms,
      it supplies an additional cause for anger on Brian&rsquo;s part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I am much obliged to you, Miss Shaw. Believe me
      that you have my sincere sympathy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff&rsquo;s farewell words were unheard. Letty had fallen forward in her
      chair, her head buried in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff went to Berkeley Square and found Lady Mary waiting for him.
      Sir William Trencham, the great solicitor, was with her. Lady Mary
      introduced the two men. All the time she was anxiously watching Ruff&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ruff has been to see Miss Shaw,&rdquo; she explained to Sir William. &ldquo;Mr.
      Ruff, tell me quickly,&rdquo; she continued, with her hand upon his shoulder,
      &ldquo;did she say anything? Did you find anything out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I found nothing out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think, then,&rdquo; Lady Mary gasped, &ldquo;that there is any chance&mdash;of
      getting her to confess&mdash;that she did it herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should she have done it herself?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked. &ldquo;She admits that
      the man tried to make love to her. She simply left him. She was in her own
      home, with her mother and servant within call. There was no struggle in
      the room&mdash;we know that. There was no necessity for any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you made any other enquiries?&rdquo; Lady Mary asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The few which I have made,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered gravely, &ldquo;point all in
      the same direction. I ascertained at the Milan that your brother called
      there late last night, and that he heard Miss Shaw had been supping alone
      with Austen Abbott. He followed them home. I have ascertained, too, that
      he had a key to Miss Shaw&rsquo;s flat. He apparently met Austen Abbott upon the
      threshold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary covered her face with her hands. She seemed to read in Ruff&rsquo;s
      words the verdict of the two men&mdash;the verdict of common sense.
      Nevertheless, he made one more request before leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see Captain Sotherst, if you can get me an order,&rdquo; he
      said to Sir William.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go with me to-morrow morning,&rdquo; the lawyer answered. &ldquo;The
      proceedings this morning, of course, were simply formal. Until after the
      inquest it will be easy to arrange an interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary looked up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is still something in your mind, then?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You think that
      there is a bare chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is always the hundredth chance!&rdquo; Peter Ruff replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff and Miss Brown supped at the Milan that night as they had
      arranged, but it was not a cheerful evening. Brian Sotherst had been very
      popular among Letty Shaw&rsquo;s little circle of friends, and the general
      feeling was one of horror and consternation at this thing which had
      befallen him. Austen Abbot, too, was known to all of them, and although a
      good many of the men&mdash;and even the women&mdash;were outspoken enough
      to declare at once that it served him right, nevertheless, the shock of
      death&mdash;death without a second&rsquo;s warning&mdash;had a paralysing effect
      even upon those who were his severest critics. Violet Brown spoke to a few
      of her friends&mdash;introduced Peter Ruff here and there&mdash;but
      nothing was said which could throw in any way even the glimmerings of a
      new light upon the tragedy. It all seemed too hopelessly and fatally
      obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      About twenty minutes before closing time, the habitues of the place were
      provided with something in the nature of a sensation. A little party
      entered who seemed altogether free from the general air of gloom. Foremost
      among them was a very young and exceedingly pretty girl, with light golden
      hair waved in front of her forehead, deep blue eyes, and the slight, airy
      figure of a child. She was accompanied by another young woman, whose
      appearance was a little too obvious to be prepossessing, and three or four
      young men&mdash;dark, clean-shaven, dressed with the irritating exactness
      of their class&mdash;young stockbrokers or boys about town. Miss Brown&rsquo;s
      eyes grew very wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a little beast!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That pretty girl there,&rdquo; she answered&mdash;&ldquo;Fluffy Dean her name is. She
      is Letty Shaw&rsquo;s protege, and she wouldn&rsquo;t have dreamed of allowing her to
      come out with a crowd like that. Tonight, of all nights,&rdquo; she continued,
      indignantly, &ldquo;when Letty is away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff was interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is Miss Fluffy Dean,&rdquo; he remarked, looking at her curiously. &ldquo;She
      seems a little excited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a horrid little wretch!&rdquo; Miss Brown declared. &ldquo;I hope that some one
      will tell Letty, and that she will drop her now. A girl who would do such
      a thing as that when Letty is in such trouble isn&rsquo;t worth taking care of!
      Just listen to them all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were certainly becoming a little boisterous. A magnum of champagne
      was being opened. Fluffy Dean&rsquo;s cheeks were already flushed, and her eyes
      glittering. Every one at the table was talking a great deal and drinking
      toasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the end of Fluffy Dean,&rdquo; Violet Brown said, severely. &ldquo;I hate to
      be uncharitable, but it serves her right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff paid his bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the taxicab, on their way back to Miss Brown&rsquo;s rooms, Ruff was
      unusually silent, but just before he said good night to her&mdash;on the
      pavement, in fact, outside her front door&mdash;he asked a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would you like to play detective for an hour or two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I always like to help in anything that&rsquo;s going,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letty Shaw was an Australian, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was born there, and lived there till she was nearly eighteen&mdash;is
      that true?&rdquo; he asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; Miss Brown answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the offices of the P.&amp; O. line of steamers in Pall Mall?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a sailing list to Australia&mdash;there should be a boat going
      Thursday. Present yourself as a prospective passenger. See how many young
      women alone there are going out, and ask their names. Incidentally put in
      a little spare time watching the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with parted lips and wide-open eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook her hand warmly and stepped back into the taxicab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No questions, please. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t expect you at the
      office at the usual time to-morrow, at any rate. Telephone or run around
      if you&rsquo;ve anything to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The taxicab disappeared round the corner of the street. Miss Brown was
      standing still upon the pavement with the latchkey in her hand.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It was afternoon before the inquest on the body of Austen Abbott, and
      there was gathered together in Letty Shaw&rsquo;s parlor a curiously assorted
      little group of people. There was Miss Shaw herself&mdash;or rather what
      seemed to be the ghost of herself&mdash;and her mother; Lady Mary and Sir
      William Trencham; Peter Ruff and Violet Brown&mdash;and Mr. John Dory. The
      eyes of all of them were fixed upon Peter Ruff, who was the latest
      arrival. He stood in the middle of the room, calmly taking off his gloves,
      and glancing complacently down at his well-creased trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Mary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and Miss Shaw, I know that you are both anxious for
      me to explain why I ask you to meet me here this afternoon, and why I also
      requested my friend Mr. Dory from Scotland Yard, who has charge of the
      case against Captain Sotherst, to be present. I will tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dory nodded, a little impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless you have something very definite to say,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I think it
      would be as well to postpone any general discussion of this matter until
      after the inquest. I must warn you that so far as I, personally, am
      concerned, I must absolutely decline to allude to the subject at all. It
      would be most unprofessional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something definite to say,&rdquo; Peter Ruff declared, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary&rsquo;s eyes flashed with hope&mdash;Letty Shaw leaned forward in her
      chair with white, drawn face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be understood,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, with a slight note of gravity
      creeping into his tone, &ldquo;that I am here solely as the agent of Lady Mary
      Sotherst. I am paid and employed by her. My sole object is on her behalf,
      therefore, to discover proof of the innocence of Captain Sotherst. I take
      it, however,&rdquo; he added, turning towards the drooping figure in the
      easy-chair, &ldquo;that Miss Shaw is as anxious to have the truth known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! Of course!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In France,&rdquo; Peter Ruff continued, &ldquo;there is a somewhat curious custom,
      which, despite a certain theatricality, yet has its points. The scene of a
      crime is visited, and its events, so far as may be, reconstructed. Let us
      suppose for a moment that we are now engaged upon something of the sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Letty Shaw shrank back in her chair. Her thin white fingers were gripping
      its sides. Her eyes seemed to look upon terrible things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too&mdash;awful!&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, firmly, &ldquo;we seek the truth. Be so good as to
      humour me in this. Dory, will you go to the front door, stand upon the mat&mdash;so?
      You are Captain Sotherst&mdash;you have just entered. I am Austen Abbott.
      You, Miss Shaw, have just ordered me from the room. You see, I move toward
      the door. I open it&mdash;so. Miss Shaw,&rdquo; he added, turning swiftly
      towards her, &ldquo;once more will you assure me that every one who was in the
      flat that night, with the exception of your domestic servant, is present
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Then who,&rdquo; he asked, suddenly pointing to a door on the left&mdash;&ldquo;who
      is in that room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had all crowded after him to the threshold&mdash;thronging around him
      as he stood face to face with John Dory. His finger never wavered&mdash;it
      was pointing steadily towards that closed door a few feet to the left.
      Suddenly Letty Shaw rushed past them with a loud shriek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not go in!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What business is it of his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood with her back to the door, her arms outstretched like a cross.
      Her cheeks were livid. Her eyes seemed starting from her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff and John Dory laid their hands upon the girl&rsquo;s wrists. She
      clung to her place frantically. She was dragged from it, screaming. Peter
      Ruff, as was his right, entered first. Almost immediately he turned round,
      and his face was very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has happened in here, I am afraid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Please come in
      quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the bed lay Fluffy Dean, fully dressed&mdash;motionless. One hand hung
      down toward the floor&mdash;from the lifeless fingers a little phial had
      slipped. The room was full of trunks addressed to&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                           MISS SMITH,
                      Passenger to Melborne.
                         S.S. Caroline.
</pre>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff moved over toward the bed and took up a piece of paper, upon
      which were scribbled a few lines in pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I must read these aloud. You all have a right to
      hear them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one spoke. He continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgive me, Letty, but I cannot go to Australia. They would only bring me
      back. When I remember that awful moment, my brain burns&mdash;I feel that
      I am going mad! Some day I should do this&mdash;better now. Give my love
      to the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      FLUFFY.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sent for a doctor, and John Dory rang up Scotland Yard. Letty Shaw
      had fainted, and had been carried to her room. While they waited about in
      strange, half-benumbed excitement, Peter Ruff once more spoke to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reconstruction is easy enough now,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;The partition
      between this sitting room and that little bedroom is only an artificial
      one&mdash;something almost as flimsy as a screen. You see,&rdquo; he continued,
      tapping with his knuckles, &ldquo;you can almost put your hand through it. If
      you look a little lower down, you will see where an opening has been made.
      Fluffy Dean was being taken care of by Miss Shaw&mdash;staying with her
      here, even. Miss Dean hears her lover&rsquo;s voice in this room&mdash;hears him
      pleading with Miss Shaw on he night of the murder. She has been sent home
      early from the theatre, and it is just possible that she saw or had been
      told that Austen Abbott had fetched Miss Shaw after the performance and
      had taken her to supper. She was mad with anger and jealousy. The revolver
      was there upon the table, with a silver box of cartridges. She possessed
      herself of it and waited in her room. What she heard proved, at least, her
      lover&rsquo;s infidelity. She stood there at her door, waiting. When Austen
      Abbott comes out, she shoots, throws the revolver at him, closes her door,
      and goes off into a faint. Perhaps she hears footsteps&mdash;a key in the
      door. At any rate, Captain Sotherst arrives a few minutes later. He finds,
      half in the hall, half on the threshold of the sitting room, Austen Abbott
      dead, and Miss Shaw&rsquo;s revolver by the side of him. If he had been a wise
      young man, he would have aroused the household. Why he did not do so, we
      can perhaps guess. He put two and two together a little too quickly. It is
      certain that he believed that the dead man had been shot by his fiancee.
      His first thought was to get rid of the revolver. At any rate, he walked
      down to the street with it in his hand, and was promptly arrested by the
      policeman who had heard the shot. Naturally he refused to plead, because
      he believed that Miss Shaw had killed the man, probably in self-defence.
      She, at first, believed her lover guilty, and when afterwards Fluffy Dean
      confessed, she, with feminine lack of common sense, was trying to get the
      girl out of the country before telling the truth. A visit of hers to the
      office of the steamship company gave me the clue I required.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary grasped both his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Scotland Yard,&rdquo; she exclaimed, with a withering glance at Dory, &ldquo;have
      done their best to hang my brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lady Mary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;remember that it is the business of Scotland
      Yard to find a man guilty. It is mine, when I am employed for that
      purpose, to find him innocent. You must not be too hard upon my friend Mr.
      Dory. He and I seem to come up against each other a little too often, as
      it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little too often!&rdquo; John Dory repeated, softly. &ldquo;But one cannot tell.
      Don&rsquo;t believe, Lady Mary,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that we ever want to kill an
      innocent man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your profession, though,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;to find criminals&mdash;and
      his,&rdquo; she added, touching Peter Ruff on the shoulder, &ldquo;to look for the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff bowed low&mdash;the compliment pleased him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. DELILAH FROM STREATHAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a favourite theory with Peter Ruff that the morning papers received
      very insufficient consideration from the majority of the British public. A
      glance at the headlines and a few of the spiciest paragraphs, a vague look
      at the leading article, and the sheets were thrown away to make room for
      more interesting literature. It was not so with Peter Ruff. Novels he very
      seldom read&mdash;he did not, in fact, appreciate the necessity for their
      existence. The whole epitome of modern life was, he argued, to be found
      among the columns of the daily press. The police news, perhaps, was his
      favourite study, but he did not neglect the advertisements. It followed,
      therefore, as a matter of course, that the appeal of &ldquo;M&rdquo; in the personal
      column of the Daily Mail was read by him on the morning of its appearance&mdash;read
      not once only nor twice&mdash;it was a paragraph which had its own
      peculiar interest for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, if still in England, is requested to communicate
      with &ldquo;M,&rdquo; at Vagali&rsquo;s Library, Cook&rsquo;s Alley, Ledham Street, Soho.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff laid the paper down upon his desk and looked steadily at a box
      of India-rubber bands. Almost his fingers, as he parted with the
      newspaper, had seemed to be shaking. His eyes were certainly set in an
      unusually retrospective stare. Who was this who sought to probe his past,
      to renew an acquaintance with a dead personality? &ldquo;M&rdquo; could be but one
      person! What did she want of him? Was it possible that, after all, a
      little flame of sentiment had been kept alight in her bosom, too&mdash;that
      in the quiet moments her thoughts had turned towards him as his had so
      often done to her? Then a sudden idea&mdash;an ugly thought&mdash;drove
      the tenderness from his face. She was no longer Maud Barnes&mdash;she was
      Mrs. John Dory, and John Dory was his enemy! Could there be treachery
      lurking beneath those simple lines? Things had not gone well with John
      Dory lately. Somehow or other, his cases seemed to have crumpled into
      dust. He was no longer held in the same esteem at headquarters. Yet could
      even John Dory stoop to such means as these?
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Brown,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;please take your pencil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite ready, sir,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He marked the advertisement with a ring and passed it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reply to that as follows,&rdquo; he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR SIR:
    </p>
    <p>
      I notice in the Daily Mail of this morning that you are enquiring through
      the &ldquo;personal&rdquo; column for the whereabouts of Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald. That
      gentleman has been a client of mine, and I have been in occasional
      communication with him. If you will inform me of the nature of your
      business, I may, perhaps, be able to put you in touch with Mr. Fitzgerald.
      You will understand, however, that, under the circumstances, I shall
      require proofs of your good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      PETER RUFF.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown glanced through the advertisement and closed her notebook with
      a little snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say&mdash;&lsquo;Dear Sir&rsquo;?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you really mean,&rdquo; she continued, with obvious disapproval, &ldquo;that I am
      to send this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not usually waste my time,&rdquo; Peter Ruff reminded her, mildly, &ldquo;by
      giving you down communications destined for the waste-paper basket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned unwillingly to her machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fitzgerald is very much better where he is,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She adjusted a sheet of paper into her typewriter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you suppose &lsquo;M&rsquo; is?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your assistance,&rdquo; Peter Ruff remarked, a little sarcastically&mdash;&ldquo;with
      your very kind assistance&mdash;I propose to find out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown sniffed, and banged at the keys of her typewriter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That coal-dealer&rsquo;s girl from Streatham!&rdquo; she murmured to herself....
    </p>
    <p>
      A few politely worded letters were exchanged. &ldquo;M&rdquo; declined to reveal her
      identity, but made an appointment to visit Mr. Ruff at his office. The
      morning she was expected, he wore an entirely new suit of clothes and was
      palpably nervous. Miss Brown, who had arrived a little late, sat with her
      back turned upon him, and ignored even his usual morning greeting. The
      atmosphere of the office was decidedly chilly! Fortunately, the expected
      visitor arrived early.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff rose to receive his former sweetheart with an agitation
      perforce concealed, yet to him poignant indeed. For it was indeed Maud who
      entered the room and came towards him with carefully studied embarrassment
      and half doubtfully extended hand. He did not see the cheap millinery, the
      slightly more developed figure, the passing of that insipid prettiness
      which had once charmed him into the bloom of an over-early maturity. His
      eyes were blinded with that sort of masculine chivalry&mdash;the heritage
      only of fools and very clever men&mdash;which takes no note of such
      things. It was Miss Brown who, from her place in a corner of the room, ran
      over the cheap attractions of this unwelcome visitor with an expression of
      scornful wonder&mdash;who understood the tinsel of her jewellery, the
      cheap shoddiness of her ready-made gown; who appreciated, with merciless
      judgment, her mincing speech, her cheap, flirtatious method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maud, with a diffidence not altogether assumed, had accepted the chair
      which Peter Ruff had placed for her, and sat fidgeting, for a moment, with
      the imitation gold purse which she was carrying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure, Mr. Ruff,&rdquo; she said, looking demurely into her lap, &ldquo;I ought
      not to have come here. I feel terribly guilty. It&rsquo;s such an uncomfortable
      sort of position, too, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry that you find it so,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;If there is anything I
      can do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; she murmured, half raising her eyes to his and
      dropping them again, &ldquo;but, you see, we are perfect strangers to one
      another. You don&rsquo;t know me at all, do you? And I have only heard of you
      through the newspapers. You might think all sorts of things about my
      coming here to make enquiries about a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can assure you,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, sincerely, &ldquo;that you need have no
      fears&mdash;no fears at all. Just speak to me quite frankly. Mr.
      Fitzgerald was a friend of yours, was he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maud simpered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was more than that,&rdquo; she answered, looking down. &ldquo;We were engaged to
      be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew all about it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Fitzgerald used to tell me
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were his friend?&rdquo; she asked, looking him in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered fervently, &ldquo;his best friend! No one was more
      grieved than I about that&mdash;little mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In some ways,&rdquo; she remarked softly, &ldquo;you remind me of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could scarcely say anything,&rdquo; Peter Ruff murmured &ldquo;which would give
      me more pleasure. I am flattered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t flattery,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the truth. You may be a few years
      older, and Spencer had a very nice moustache, which you haven&rsquo;t, but you
      are really not unlike. Mr. Ruff, do tell me where he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must remember,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Mr. Fitzgerald&rsquo;s absence was caused by
      events of a somewhat unfortunate character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about it,&rdquo; she answered, with a little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can appreciate the fact, therefore,&rdquo; Peter Ruff continued, &ldquo;that as
      his friend and well-wisher I can scarcely disclose his whereabouts without
      his permission. Will you tell me exactly why you want to meet him again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blushed&mdash;looked down and up again&mdash;betrayed, in fact, all
      the signs of confusion which might have been expected from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I tell you that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are married, are you not?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked, looking down at her
      wedding ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bit her lip with vexation. What a fool she had been not to take it
      off!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Well, no&mdash;that is to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Peter Ruff interrupted. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t think that I want to
      cross-examine you. I only asked these questions because I have a sincere
      regard for Fitzgerald. I know how fond he was of you, and I cannot see
      what there is to be gained, from his point of view, by reopening old
      wounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, then,&rdquo; she remarked, looking at him in such a manner that Miss
      Brown had to cover her mouth with her hands to prevent her screaming out&mdash;&ldquo;I
      suppose you are one of those who think it a crime for a woman who is
      married even to want to see, for a few moments, an old sweetheart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered, &ldquo;as a bachelor, I have no
      convictions of any sort upon the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of that,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to understand, then,&rdquo; Peter Ruff remarked, &ldquo;that your reason for
      wishing to meet Mr. Fitzgerald again is purely a sentimental one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it is,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;I have thought of him so often lately.
      He was such a dear!&rdquo; she declared, with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been sufficiently thankful,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that he got
      away that night. At the time, I was very angry, but often since then I
      have wished that I could have passed out with him into the fog and been
      lost&mdash;but I mustn&rsquo;t talk like this! Please don&rsquo;t misunderstand me,
      Mr. Ruff. I am happily married&mdash;quite happily married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend Fitzgerald,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;will be glad to hear that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maud fidgeted. It was not quite the effect she had intended to produce!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she remarked, looking away with a pensive air, &ldquo;one has
      regrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regrets!&rdquo; Peter Ruff murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dory is not well off,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and I am afraid that I am very
      fond of life and going about, and everything is so expensive nowadays.
      Then I don&rsquo;t like his profession. I think it is hateful to be always
      trying to catch people and put them in prison&mdash;don&rsquo;t you, Mr. Ruff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Your husband and I work from the opposite poles
      of life. He is always seeking to make criminals of the people whom I am
      always trying to prove worthy members of society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How noble!&rdquo; Maud exclaimed, clasping her hands and looking up at him. &ldquo;So
      much more remunerative, too, I should think,&rdquo; she added, after a moment&rsquo;s
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Peter Ruff admitted. &ldquo;A private individual will pay more to
      escape from the clutches of the law than the law will to secure its
      victims. Scotland Yard expects them to come into its arms automatically&mdash;regards
      them as a perquisite of its existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish my husband were in your profession, Mr. Ruff,&rdquo; Maud said, with a
      sidelong glance of her blue eyes which she had always found so effective
      upon her various admirers. &ldquo;I am sure that I should be a great deal fonder
      of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff leaned forward in his chair. He, too, had expressive eyes at
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and stopped. But Maud blushed, all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked down into her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are forgetting Mr. Fitzgerald,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff glanced up at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long story,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Are you in a hurry, Mrs. Dory?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; she assured him, &ldquo;unless you want to close you office, or
      anything. It must be nearly one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;if you would do me the honour of lunching with me?
      We might go to the Prince&rsquo;s or the Carlton&mdash;whichever you prefer. I
      will promise to talk about Mr. Fitzgerald all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Maud declared, with a little gasp. &ldquo;At least&mdash;well,
      I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no engagement for luncheon?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but, you see, we live so quietly. I have never
      been to one of those places. I&rsquo;d love to go&mdash;but if we were seen!
      Wouldn&rsquo;t people talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff smiled. Just the same dear, modest little thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can assure you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that nothing whatever could be said against
      our lunching together. People are not so strict nowadays, you know, and a
      married lady has always a great deal of latitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him with a dazzling smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d simply love to go to Prince&rsquo;s!&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cat!&rdquo; Miss Brown murmured, as Peter Ruff and his client left the room
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff returned from his luncheon in no very jubilant state of mind.
      For some time he sat in his easy-chair, with his legs crossed and his
      finger tips pressed close together, looking steadily into space. Contrary
      to his usual custom, he did not smoke. Miss Brown watched him from behind
      her machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disenchanted?&rdquo; she asked calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff did not reply for several moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he admitted, hesitatingly, &ldquo;that marriage with John Dory
      has&mdash;well, not had a beneficial effect. She allowed me, for instance,
      to hold her hand in the cab! Maud would never have permitted a stranger to
      take such a liberty in the old days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown smiled curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff felt that he was in the confessional.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She certainly did seem,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;to enjoy her champagne a great
      deal, and she talked about her dull life at home a little more, perhaps,
      than was discreet to one who was presumably a stranger. She was curious,
      too, about dining out. Poor little girl, though. Just fancy, John Dory has
      never taken her anywhere but to Lyons&rsquo; or an A B C, and the pit of a
      theatre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which evening is it to be?&rdquo; Miss Brown asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something was said about Thursday,&rdquo; Peter Ruff admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her husband?&rdquo; Miss Brown enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He happens to be in Glasgow for a few days,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown looked at her employer steadily. She addressed him by his
      Christian name, which was a thing she very seldom did in office hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are you going to let that woman make a fool of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;say anything you want to&mdash;only, if you please,
      don&rsquo;t speak disrespectfully of Maud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it ever occurred to you at all,&rdquo; Miss Brown continued, rising to
      her feet, &ldquo;that this Maud, or whatever you want to call her, may be
      playing a low-down game of her husband&rsquo;s? He hates you, and he has vague
      suspicions. Can&rsquo;t you see that he is probably making use of your
      infatuation for his common, middle-class little wife, to try and get you
      to give yourself away? Can&rsquo;t you see it, Peter? You are not going to tell
      me that you are so blind as all that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must admit,&rdquo; he answered with a sigh, &ldquo;that, although I think you go
      altogether too far, some suspicion of the sort has interfered with my
      perfect enjoyment of the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brown drew a little breath of relief. After all, then, his folly was
      not so consummate as it had seemed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do about it, then?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff coughed&mdash;he seemed in an unusually amenable frame of mind,
      and submitted to cross-examination without murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The subject of Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;seemed, somehow or
      other, to drop into the background during our luncheon. I propose,
      therefore, to continue to offer to Mrs. John Dory my most respectful
      admiration. If she accepts my friendship, and is satisfied with it, so
      much the better. I must admit that it would give me a great deal of
      pleasure to be her occasional companion&mdash;at such times when her
      husband happens to be in Glasgow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And supposing,&rdquo; Miss Brown asked, &ldquo;that this is not all she wants&mdash;supposing,
      for instance, that she persists in her desire for information concerning
      Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Peter Ruff admitted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that I must conclude that her
      unchivalrous clod of a husband has indeed stooped to make a fool of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in that case,&rdquo; Miss Brown demanded, &ldquo;what shall you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just thinking that out,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said mildly, &ldquo;when you
      spoke....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The friendship of Peter Ruff with the wife of his enemy certainly appeared
      to progress in most satisfactory fashion. The dinner and visit to the
      theatre duly took place. Mr. Ruff was afterwards permitted to offer a
      slight supper and to accompany his fair companion a portion of the way
      home in a taxicab. She made several half-hearted attempts to return to the
      subject of Spencer Fitzgerald, but her companion had been able on each
      occasion to avoid the subject. Whether or not she was the victim of her
      husband&rsquo;s guile, there was no question about the reality of her enjoyment
      during the evening. Ruff, when he remembered the flash of her eyes across
      the table, the touch of her fingers in the taxi, was almost content to
      believe her false to her truant lover. If only she had not been married to
      John Dory, he realised, with a little sigh, that he might have taught her
      to forget that such a person existed as Spencer Fitzgerald, might have
      induced her to become Mrs. Peter Ruff!
    </p>
    <p>
      On their next meeting, however, Peter Ruff was forced to realise that his
      secretary&rsquo;s instinct had not misled her. It was, alas, no personal and
      sentimental regrets for her former lover which had brought the fair Maud
      to his office. The pleasures of her evening&mdash;they dined at Romano&rsquo;s
      and had a box at the Empire&mdash;were insufficient this time to keep her
      from recurring continually to the subject of her vanished lover. He tried
      strategy&mdash;jealousy amongst other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing,&rdquo; he said, as they sat quite close to one another in the box
      during the interval, &ldquo;supposing I were to induce our friend to come to
      London&mdash;I imagine he would be fairly safe now if he kept out of your
      husband&rsquo;s way&mdash;what would happen to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; she murmured, glancing at him from behind her fan and then dropping
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;me!&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that I should be
      doing myself a very ill turn if I brought you two together? I have very
      few friends, and I cannot afford to lose one. I am quite sure that you
      still care for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a scrap!&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you put that advertisement in the paper?&rdquo; Ruff asked, with
      smooth but swift directness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not quick enough to parry his question. He read the truth in her
      disconcerted face. Knowing it now for a certainty, he hastened to her aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said, looking away. &ldquo;I should not have asked that
      question&mdash;it is not my business. I will write to Fitzgerald. I will
      tell him that you want to see him, and that I think it would be safe for
      him to come to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maud recovered herself quickly. She thanked him with her eyes as well as
      her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you needn&rsquo;t be jealous, really,&rdquo; she whispered behind her fan. &ldquo;I
      only want to see him once for a few minutes&mdash;to ask a question. After
      that, I don&rsquo;t care what becomes of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A poor sort of Delilah, really, with her flushed face, her too elaborately
      coiffured hair with its ugly ornament, her ready-made evening dress with
      its cheap attempts at smartness, her cleaned gloves, indifferent shoes.
      But Peter Ruff thought otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that, after I have found him for you, you will still come out
      with me again sometimes?&rdquo; he asked wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Whenever I can without John knowing,&rdquo; she
      added, with an unpleasant little laugh. &ldquo;If you only knew how I loved the
      music and the theatres, and this sort of life! What a good time your wife
      would have, Mr. Ruff!&rdquo; she added archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no joking matter with him. He had to remember that he was, in
      effect, her tool, that she was making use of him, willing to betray her
      former lover at her husband&rsquo;s bidding. It was enough to make him, on his
      side, burn for revenge! Yet he put the thought away from him with a
      shiver. She was still the woman he had loved&mdash;she was still sacred to
      him! That night he pleaded an engagement, and sent her home in a taxicab
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Dory, waiting patiently at home for his wife&rsquo;s return, felt a certain
      uneasiness when she swept into their little sitting room in all her cheap
      splendour, with flushed cheeks&mdash;an obvious air of satisfaction with
      herself and disdain for her immediate surroundings. John Dory was a
      commonplace looking man&mdash;the absence of his collar, and his somewhat
      shabby carpet slippers, did not improve his appearance. He had neglected
      to shave, and he was drinking beer. At headquarters he was not considered
      quite the smart young officer which he had once shown signs of becoming.
      He looked at his wife with darkening face, and his wife, on her part,
      thought of Peter Ruff in his immaculate evening clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he remarked, grumblingly, &ldquo;you seem to find a good deal of
      pleasure in this gadding about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw her soiled fan on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;you are not the one to sit there and reproach me
      with it, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone far enough, anyway,&rdquo; John Dory said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone further than I
      meant it to go. Understand me, Maud&mdash;it&rsquo;s finished! I&rsquo;ll find your
      old sweetheart for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t trouble,&rdquo; she answered, with a little toss of the head. &ldquo;I am
      not such a fool as you seem to think me. Mr. Ruff has made an appointment
      with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a change in John Dory&rsquo;s face. The man&rsquo;s eyes were bright&mdash;they
      almost glittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that your friend Mr. Ruff is going to produce Spencer
      Fitzgerald?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has promised to,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she declared, throwing herself
      into an easy-chair, &ldquo;I feel horrid about it. I wonder what Mr. Ruff will
      think when he knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can feel how you like,&rdquo; John Dory answered bluntly, &ldquo;so long as I get
      the handcuffs on Spencer Fitzgerald&rsquo;s wrists!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered. She looked at her husband with distaste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about it!&rdquo; she begged sharply. &ldquo;It makes me feel the meanest
      creature that ever crawled. I can&rsquo;t help feeling, too, that Mr. Ruff will
      think me a wretch&mdash;quite the gentleman he&rsquo;s been all the time! I
      never knew any one half so nice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory set down his empty glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said, looking at her thoughtfully, &ldquo;what made him take such
      a fancy to you! Rather sudden, wasn&rsquo;t it, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maud tossed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything so wonderful about that,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Maud,&rdquo; her husband said, rising to his feet. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t a
      fool&mdash;not quite. You&rsquo;ve spent some time with Peter Ruff. How much&mdash;think
      carefully&mdash;how much does he remind you of Spencer Fitzgerald?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; she answered promptly. &ldquo;Why, he is years older, and though
      Spencer was quite the gentleman, there&rsquo;s something about Mr. Ruff, and the
      way he dresses and knows his way about&mdash;well, you can tell he&rsquo;s been
      a gentleman all his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory&rsquo;s face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think again,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see any likeness,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;He did remind me a little of him
      just at first, though,&rdquo; she added, reflectively&mdash;&ldquo;little things he
      said, and sort of mannerisms. I&rsquo;ve sort of lost sight of them the last few
      times, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is this meeting with Fitzgerald to come off?&rdquo; John Dory asked
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer him at once. A low, triumphant smile had parted her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow night,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he is to meet me in Mr. Ruff&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what time?&rdquo; John Dory asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Mr. Ruff is keeping his office open
      late on purpose. Spencer thinks that afterwards he is going to take me out
      to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure of this?&rdquo; John Dory asked eagerly. &ldquo;You are sure that the
      man Ruff does not suspect you? You believe he means that you shall meet
      Fitzgerald?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He is even a little jealous,&rdquo; she
      continued, with an affected laugh. &ldquo;He told me&mdash;well, never mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told you what?&rdquo; John Dory asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have done what you asked me anyway. If Mr.
      Ruff had not found me an agreeable companion he would not have bothered
      about getting Spencer to meet me. And now he&rsquo;s done it,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I do
      believe he&rsquo;s a little jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory glared, but he said nothing. It seemed to him that his hour of
      revenge was close at hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first occasion upon which words of this sort had passed between
      Peter Ruff and his secretary. There was no denying the fact that Miss
      Violet Brown was in a passion. It was an hour past the time at which she
      usually left the office. For an hour she had pleaded, and Peter Ruff
      remained unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a fool!&rdquo; she cried to him at last. &ldquo;I am a fool, too, that I have
      ever wasted my thoughts and time upon you. Why can&rsquo;t I make you see? In
      every other way, heaven knows, you are clever enough! And yet there comes
      this vulgar, commonplace, tawdry little woman from heaven knows where, and
      makes such a fool of you that you are willing to fling away your career&mdash;to
      hold your wrists out for John Dory&rsquo;s handcuffs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Violet,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered deprecatingly, &ldquo;you really worry me&mdash;you
      do indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not half so much as you worry me,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Look at the time. It&rsquo;s
      already past seven. At eight o&rsquo;clock Mrs. Dory&mdash;your Maud&mdash;is
      coming in here hoping to find her old sweetheart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, indeed?&rdquo; Miss Brown answered angrily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;can&rsquo;t
      you believe&mdash;that close on her heels will come her husband&mdash;that
      Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, if ever he comes to life in this room, will leave
      it between two policemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pessimist you are, my dear Violet!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came up to him and laid her hands upon his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will tell you something&mdash;I must! I am fond of
      you, Peter. I always have been. Don&rsquo;t make me miserable if there is no
      need for it. Tell me honestly&mdash;do you really believe in this woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He removed her hands gently, and raised them to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I believe in every one until I find them out. I
      look upon suspicion as a vice. But, at the same time,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;there
      are always certain precautions which one takes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What precautions can you take?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Can you sit there and make
      yourself invisible? John Dory is not a fool. The moment he is in this room
      with the door closed behind him, it is the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must hope not,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said cheerfully. &ldquo;There are other things
      which may happen, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away from him a little drearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not mind if I stay?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am not working to-night.
      Perhaps, later on, I may be of use!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You will excuse me for a little time, won&rsquo;t
      you? I have some preparations to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head away from him. He left the room and ascended the
      stairs to his own apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight o&rsquo;clock was striking from St. Martin&rsquo;s Church when the door of Peter
      Ruff&rsquo;s office was softly opened and closed again. A man in a slouch hat
      and overcoat entered, and after feeling along the wall for a moment,
      turned up the electric light. Violet Brown rose from her place with a
      little sob. She stretched out her hand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name,&rdquo; the newcomer said calmly, &ldquo;is Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, listen to me!&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;There is still time, if you hurry. Think
      how many clever men before you have been deceived by the woman in whom
      they trusted. Please, please go! Hurry upstairs and put those things
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; the newcomer said, &ldquo;I am much obliged to you for your interest,
      but I think that you are making a mistake. I have come here to meet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short. There was a soft knocking at the door. A stifled scream
      broke from Violet Brown&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Peter! Peter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank into her chair and covered her face with her hands. The door was
      opened and Maud came in. When she saw who it was who sat in Peter Ruff&rsquo;s
      place, she gave a little cry. Perhaps after all, she had not believed that
      this thing would happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spencer!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Spencer! Have you really come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are glad to see me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came slowly forward. The man rose from his place and came towards her
      with outstretched hands. Then through the door came John Dory, and one
      caught a glimpse of others behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my wife is not glad to see you, Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald,&rdquo; he aid, in a
      tone from which he vainly tried to keep the note of triumph, &ldquo;I can assure
      you that I am. You slipped away from me cleverly at Daisy Villa, but this
      time I think you will not find it so easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maud shrank back, and her husband took her place. But Mr. Spencer
      Fitzgerald looked upon them both as one who looks upon figures in a dream.
      Miss Brown rose hurriedly from her seat. She came over to him and thrust
      her arm through his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she said, taking his hand in hers, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t shoot. It isn&rsquo;t worth
      while. You should have listened to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man in the gold-rimmed spectacles looked at her, looked at Mr.
      John Dory, looked at the woman who was shrinking back now against the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is the most extraordinary situation in which I
      ever found myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will help you to realise it,&rdquo; John Dory cried, and the triumph in his
      tone had swelled into a deeper note. &ldquo;I came here to arrest Mr.
      Fitzgerald, but I hear this young lady call you &lsquo;Peter.&rsquo; Perhaps this may
      be the solution&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man struck the table with the flat of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is getting a bit too thick. First of all&mdash;you,&rdquo;
       he said, turning to Miss Brown&mdash;&ldquo;my name is not Peter, and I have no
      idea of shooting anybody. As for that lady against the wall, I don&rsquo;t know
      her&mdash;never saw her before in my life. As for you,&rdquo; he added, turning
      to John Dory, &ldquo;you talk about arresting me&mdash;what for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Dory smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is an old warrant,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which I have in my pocket, but I
      fancy that there are a few little things since then which we may have to
      enquire into.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This beats me!&rdquo; the little man declared. &ldquo;Who do you think I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, to start with,&rdquo; John Dory said. &ldquo;It seems to me
      not impossible that we may find another pseudonym for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can find as many as you like,&rdquo; the little man answered testily, &ldquo;but
      my name is James Fitzgerald, and I am an actor employed at the Shaftesbury
      Theatre, as I can prove with the utmost ease. I never called myself
      Spencer; nor, to my knowledge, was I ever called by such a name. Nor, as I
      remarked before, have I ever seen any one of you three people before with
      the exception of Miss Brown here, whom I have seen on the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a clerk in Howell &amp;
      Wilson&rsquo;s bookshop, who leapt out of the window of Daisy Villa two years
      ago. It may be Mr. James Fitzgerald now. Gentlemen of your profession have
      a knack of changing their names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My profession&rsquo;s as good as yours, anyway!&rdquo; the little man exclaimed. &ldquo;We
      aren&rsquo;t all fools in it! My friend Mr. Peter Ruff said to me that there was
      a young lady whom I used to know who was anxious to meet me again, and
      would I step around here about eight o&rsquo;clock. Here I am, and all I can say
      is, if that&rsquo;s the young lady, I never saw her before in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s breathless silence. Then the door was softly opened.
      Violet Brown went staggering back like a woman who sees a ghost. She bit
      her lips till the blood came. It was Peter Ruff who stood looking in upon
      them&mdash;Peter Ruff, carefully dressed in evening clothes, his silk hat
      at exactly the correct angle, his coat and white kid gloves upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t seem to be getting on very well! Mr. Dory,&rdquo;
       he added, with a note of surprise in his tone, &ldquo;this is indeed an
      unexpected pleasure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man who stood by the desk turned to him. The others were stricken
      dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some mistake. You told me to come here at
      eight o&rsquo;clock to meet a young lady whom I used to know. Well, I never saw
      her before in my life,&rdquo; he added, pointing to Maud. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man there
      who wants to arrest me&mdash;Lord knows what for! And here&rsquo;s Miss Brown,
      whom I have seen at the theatre several times but who never condescended
      to speak to me before, telling me not to shoot! What&rsquo;s it all about, Ruff?
      Is it a practical joke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff laid down his coat and hat, and sat upon the table with his
      hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I have made a mistake? Isn&rsquo;t your second
      name Spencer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is James Fitzgerald,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t missed a day at the
      Shaftesbury Theatre for three years, as you can find out by going round
      the corner. I never called myself Spencer, I was never clerk in a
      bookshop, and I never saw that lady before in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maud came out from her place against the wall, and leaned eagerly forward.
      John Dory turned his head slowly towards his wife. A sickening fear had
      arisen in his heart&mdash;gripped him by the throat. Fooled once more, and
      by Peter Ruff!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t Spencer!&rdquo; Maud said huskily. &ldquo;Mr. Ruff,&rdquo; she added, turning to
      him, &ldquo;you know very well that this is not the Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald whom
      you promised to bring here to-night&mdash;Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald to whom I
      was once engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff pointed to the figure of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my invitation did not include your husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory took a step forward, and laid his hands upon the shoulders of
      the man who called himself Mr. James Fitzgerald. He looked into his face
      long and carefully. Then he turned away, and, gripping his wife by the
      arm, he passed out of the room. The door slammed behind him. The sound of
      heavy footsteps was heard descending to the floor below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violet Brown crossed the room to where Peter Ruff was still sitting with a
      queer look upon his face, and, gripping him by the shoulders, shook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How dare you! Do you know that I have
      nearly cried my eyes out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff came back from the world into which, for the moment, his
      thoughts had taken him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have known me for some years. You have been my
      secretary for some months. If you choose still to take me for a fool, I
      cannot help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she exclaimed, pointing to Mr. James Fitzgerald&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been practising on him for some time,&rdquo; he said, with an air of
      self-satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thin, mobile face, you see, and plenty of experience in the art of
      making up. It is astonishing what one can do if one tries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. James Fitzgerald picked up his hat and coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was worth more than five quid,&rdquo; he growled; &ldquo;when I saw the handcuffs
      in that fellow&rsquo;s hand, I felt a cold shiver go down my spine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff counted out two banknotes and passed them to his confederate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have earned the money,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go and spend it. Perhaps, Violet,&rdquo;
       he added, turning towards her, &ldquo;I have been a little inconsiderate. Come
      and have dinner with me, and forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;that you wouldn&rsquo;t rather take Maud?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. THE LITTLE LADY FROM SERVIA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Westward sped the little electric brougham, driven without regard to
      police regulations or any rule of the road: silent and swift, wholly
      regardless of other vehicles&mdash;as though, indeed, its occupants were
      assuming to themselves the rights of Royalty. Inside, Peter Ruff, a little
      breathless, was leaning forward, tying his white cravat with the aid of
      the little polished mirror set in the middle of the dark green cushions.
      At his right hand was Lady Mary, watching his proceedings with an air of
      agonised impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you&mdash;&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindly wait till I have tied this and put my studs in,&rdquo; Peter Ruff
      interrupted. &ldquo;It is impossible for me to arrive at a ball in this
      condition, and I cannot give my whole attention to more than one thing at
      a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be there in five minutes!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What is the good,
      unless you understand, of your coming at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff surveyed his tie critically. Fortunately, it pleased him. He
      began to press the studs into their places with firm fingers. Around them
      surged the traffic of Piccadilly; in front, the gleaming arc of lights
      around Hyde Park Corner. They had several narrow escapes. Once the
      brougham swayed dangerously as they cut in on the wrong side of an island
      lamp-post. A policeman shouted after them, another held up his hand&mdash;the
      driver of the brougham took no notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My younger brother&mdash;Maurice,&rdquo; she began, breathlessly&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
      never met him, I know, but you&rsquo;ve heard me speak of him. He is private
      secretary to Sir James Wentley&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minister for Foreign Affairs?&rdquo; Ruff asked, swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Maurice wants to go in for the Diplomatic Service. He is a dear, and
      so clever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Maurice who is in trouble?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he come
      himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying to explain,&rdquo; Lady Mary protested. &ldquo;This afternoon he had an
      important paper to turn into cipher and hand over to the Prime Minister at
      the Duchess of Montford&rsquo;s dance to-night. The Prime Minister will arrive
      in a motor car from the country at about two o&rsquo;clock, and the first thing
      he will ask for will be that paper. It has been stolen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what time did your brother finish copying it, and when did he discover
      its loss?&rdquo; Ruff asked, with a slight air of weariness. These preliminary
      enquiries always bored him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He finished it in his own rooms at half-past seven,&rdquo; Lady Mary answered.
      &ldquo;He discovered its loss at eleven o&rsquo;clock&mdash;directly he had arrived at
      the ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he come to me himself?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked. &ldquo;I like to have
      these particulars at first hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in attendance upon Sir James at the ball,&rdquo; Lady Mary answered.
      &ldquo;There is trouble in the East, as you know, and Sir James is expecting
      dispatches to-night. Maurice is not allowed to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he told Sir James yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had not when I left,&rdquo; Lady Mary answered. &ldquo;If he is forced to do so,
      it will be ruin! Mr. Ruff, you must help us Maurice is such a dear, but a
      mistake like this, at the very beginning of his career, would be fatal.
      Here we are. That is my brother waiting just inside the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A young man came up to them in the vestibule. He was somewhat pale, but
      otherwise perfectly self-possessed. From the shine of his glossy black
      hair to the tips of his patent boots he was, in appearance, everything
      that a young Englishman of birth and athletic tastes could hope to be.
      Peter Ruff liked the look of him. He waited for no introduction, but laid
      his hand at once upon the young man&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between seven-thirty and arriving here,&rdquo; he said, drawing him on one side&mdash;&ldquo;quick!
      Tell me, whom did you see? What opportunities were there of stealing the
      paper, and by whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I finished it at five and twenty past seven,&rdquo; the young man said, &ldquo;sealed
      it in an official envelope, and stood it up on my desk by the side of my
      coat and hat and muffler, which my servant had laid there, ready for me to
      put on. My bedroom opens out from my sitting room. While I was dressing,
      two men called for me&mdash;Paul Jermyn and Count von Hern. They walked
      through to my bedroom first, and then sat together in the sitting room
      until I came out. The door was wide open, and we talked all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They called accidentally?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;by appointment,&rdquo; the young man replied. &ldquo;We were all coming on
      here to the dance, and we had agreed to dine together first at the Savoy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that you left the paper on your desk with your coat and hat?&rdquo;
       Peter Ruff asked. &ldquo;Was it there when you came out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently so,&rdquo; the young man answered. &ldquo;It seemed to be standing in
      exactly the same place as where I had left it. I put it into my breast
      pocket, and it was only when I arrived here that I fancied the envelope
      seemed lighter. I went off by myself and tore it open. There was nothing
      inside but half a newspaper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the envelope?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked. &ldquo;That must have been the same
      sort of one as you had used or you would have noticed it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; the Honorable Maurice answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a sort which you kept in your room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; the young man admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The packet was changed, then, by some one in your room, or some one who
      had access to it,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;How about your servant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was his evening off. I let him put out my things and go at seven
      o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must tell me the nature of the contents of the packet,&rdquo; Peter Ruff
      declared. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hesitate. You must do it. Remember the alternative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man did hesitate for several moments, but a glance into his
      sister&rsquo;s appealing face decided him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was our official reply to a secret communication from Russia
      respecting&mdash;a certain matter in the Balkans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Count von Hern?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inside, dancing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must use a telephone at once,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;Ask one of the
      servants here where I can find one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff was conducted to a gloomy waiting room, on the table of which
      stood a small telephone instrument. He closed the door, but he was absent
      for only a few minutes. When he rejoined Lady Mary and her brother they
      were talking together in agitated whispers. The latter turned towards him
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you suspect Count von Hern?&rdquo; he asked, doubtfully. &ldquo;He
      is a friend of the Danish Minister&rsquo;s, and every one says that he&rsquo;s such a
      good chap. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to take the slightest interest in politics&mdash;spends
      nearly all his time hunting or playing polo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suspect any one,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;I only know that Count
      von Hern is an Austrian spy, and that he took your paper! Has he been out
      of your sight at all since you rejoined him in the sitting room? I mean to
      say&mdash;had he any opportunity of leaving you during the time you were
      dining together, or did he make any calls en route, either on the way to
      the Savoy or from the Savoy here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not been out of my sight for a second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the other man&mdash;Jermyn?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked. &ldquo;I never heard of
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An American&mdash;cousin of the Duchess. He could not have had the
      slightest interest in the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please take me into the ballroom,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said to Lady Mary. &ldquo;Your
      brother had better not come with us. I want to be as near the Count von
      Hern as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed into the crowded rooms, unnoticed, purposely avoiding the
      little space where the Duchess was still receiving the late comers among
      her guests. They found progress difficult, and Lady Mary felt her heart
      sink as she glanced at the little jewelled watch which hung from her
      wrist. Suddenly Peter Ruff came to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look for a moment,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but tell me as soon as you can&mdash;who
      is that tall young man, like a Goliath, talking to the little dark woman?
      You see whom I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary nodded, and they passed on. In a moment or two she answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange that you should ask!&rdquo; she whispered in his ear. &ldquo;That is Mr.
      Jermyn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were on the outskirts now of the ballroom itself. One of Lady Mary&rsquo;s
      partners came up with an open programme and a face full of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do please forgive me, Captain Henderson,&rdquo; Lady Mary begged. &ldquo;I have hurt
      my foot, and I am not dancing any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely I was to take you in to supper?&rdquo; the young officer protested,
      good-humouredly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that you are going to cut that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to cut everything to-night with everybody,&rdquo; Lady Mary said.
      &ldquo;Please forgive me. Come to tea to-morrow and I&rsquo;ll explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man bowed, and, with a curious glance at Ruff, accepted his
      dismissal. Another partner was simply waved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please turn round and come back,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;I want to see those
      two again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t found Count von Hern yet,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Surely that is
      more important, is it not? I believe that I saw him dancing just now&mdash;there,
      with the tall girl in yellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about him, for the moment,&rdquo; Ruff answered. &ldquo;Walk down this
      corridor with me. Do you mind talking all the time, please? It will sound
      more natural, and I want to listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young American and his partner had found a more retired seat now,
      about three quarters of the way down the pillared vestibule which bordered
      the ballroom. He was bending over his companion with an air of
      unmistakable devotion, but it was she who talked. She seemed, indeed, to
      have a good deal to say to him. The slim white fingers of one hand played
      all the time with a string of magnificent pearls. Her dark, soft eyes&mdash;black
      as aloes and absolutely un-English&mdash;flashed into his. A delightful
      smile hovered at the corners of her lips. All the time she was talking and
      he was listening. Lady Mary and her partner passed by unnoticed. At the
      end of the vestibule they turned and retraced their steps. Peter Ruff was
      very quiet&mdash;he had caught a few of those rapid words. But the woman&rsquo;s
      foreign accent had troubled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only she would speak in her own language!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary&rsquo;s hand suddenly tightened upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;That is Count von Hern!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tall, fair young man, very exact in his dress, very stiff in his
      carriage, with a not unpleasant face, was standing talking to Jermyn and
      his companion. Jermyn, who apparently found the intrusion an annoyance,
      was listening to the conversation between the two, with a frown upon his
      face and a general attitude of irritation. As Lady Mary and her escort
      drew near, the reason for the young American&rsquo;s annoyance became clearer&mdash;his
      two companions were talking softly, but with great animation, in a foreign
      language, which it was obvious that he did not understand. Peter Ruff&rsquo;s
      elbow pressed against his partner&rsquo;s arm, and their pace slackened. He
      ventured, even, to pause for a moment, looking into the ballroom as though
      in search of some one, and he had by no means the appearance of a man
      likely to understand Hungarian. Then, to Lady Mary&rsquo;s surprise, he touched
      the Count von Hern on the shoulder and addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I fancy that we accidentally
      exchanged programmes, a few minutes ago, at the buffet. I have lost mine
      and picked up one which does not belong to me. As we were standing side by
      side, it is possibly yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe not, sir,&rdquo; he answered, with that pleasant smile which had gone
      such a long way toward winning him the reputation of being &ldquo;a good fellow&rdquo;
       amongst a fairly large circle of friends. &ldquo;I believe at any rate,&rdquo; he
      added, glancing at his programme, &ldquo;that this is my own. You mistake me,
      probably, for some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff, without saying a word, was actor enough to suggest that he was
      unconvinced. The Count good-humouredly held out his programme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see for yourself,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;That is not yours, is it?
      Besides, I have not been to the buffet at all this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff cast a swift glance down the programme which the Count had
      handed him. Then he apologised profusely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was mistaken,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I am very sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of no consequence, sir,&rdquo; he said, and resumed his conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff passed on with Lady Mary. At a safe distance, she glanced at
      him enquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was his programme I wanted to see,&rdquo; Peter Ruff explained. &ldquo;It is as I
      thought. He has had four dances with the Countess&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; Lady Mary asked, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little dark lady with whom he is talking now,&rdquo; Peter Ruff continued.
      &ldquo;He seems, too, to be going early. He has no dances reserved after the
      twelfth. We will go downstairs at once, if you please. I must speak to
      your brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been able to think of anything?&rdquo; she asked, anxiously. &ldquo;Is there
      any chance at all, do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;It is most interesting. Don&rsquo;t be too
      sanguine, though. The odds are against us, and the time is very short. Is
      the driver of your electric brougham to be trusted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;He is an old servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you lend him to me?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked, &ldquo;and tell him that he is to
      obey my instructions absolutely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You are going away, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded. He was a little sparing of words just then. The
      thoughts were chasing one another through his brain. He was listening,
      too, for the sweep of a dress behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there nothing I can do?&rdquo; Lady Mary begged, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head. In the distance he saw the Honourable Maurice
      come quickly toward them. With a firm but imperceptible gesture he waved
      him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your brother speak to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t tell who is
      behind. What time did you say the Prime Minister was expected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At two o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Lady Mary said, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff glanced at his watch. It was already half an hour past
      midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will do what I can. If my theory is wrong, it
      will be nothing. If I am right&mdash;well, there is a chance, anyhow. In
      the meantime&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime?&rdquo; she repeated, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your brother back to the ballroom,&rdquo; Peter Ruff directed. &ldquo;Make him
      dance&mdash;dance yourself. Don&rsquo;t give yourselves away by looking anxious.
      When the time is short&mdash;say at a quarter to two&mdash;he can come
      down here and wait for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t come!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we shall have lost,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, calmly. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t see me
      again to-night, you had better read the newspapers carefully for the next
      few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to do something dangerous!&rdquo; she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is danger in interfering at all in such a matter as this,&rdquo; he
      answered, &ldquo;but you must remember that it is not only my profession&mdash;it
      is my hobby. Remember, too,&rdquo; he added, with a smile, &ldquo;that I do not often
      lose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For twenty minutes Peter Ruff sat in the remote corner of Lady Mary&rsquo;s
      electric brougham, drawn up at the other side of the Square, and waited.
      At last he pressed a button. They glided off. Before them was a large,
      closed motor car. They started in discreet chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, however, the chase was not a long one. The car which Peter
      Ruff had been following was drawn up before a plain, solid-looking house,
      unlit and of gloomy appearance. The little lady with the wonderful eyes
      was already halfway up the flagged steps. Hastily lifting the flap and
      looking behind as they passed, her pursuer saw her open the door with a
      latchkey, and disappear. Peter Ruff pulled the check-string and descended.
      For several moments he stood and observed the house into which the lady
      whom he had been following had disappeared. Then he turned to the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to watch that house,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;never to take your eyes off
      it. When I reappear from it, if I do at all, I shall probably be in a
      hurry. Directly you see me be on your box ready to start. A good deal may
      depend upon our getting away quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;How long am I to wait here for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff&rsquo;s lips twisted into a curious little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until two o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If I am not out by then, you needn&rsquo;t
      bother any more about me. You can return and tell your mistress exactly
      what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I better come and try and get you out, sir?&rdquo; the man asked.
      &ldquo;Begging your pardon, but her Ladyship told me that there might be queer
      doings. I&rsquo;m a bit useful in a scrap, sir,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I do a bit of
      sparring regularly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any scrap at all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you had better be out of it. Do
      as I have said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The motor car had turned round and disappeared now, and in a few moments
      Peter Ruff stood before the door of the house into which the little lady
      had disappeared. The problem of entrance was already solved for him. The
      door had been left unlatched; only a footstool had been placed against it
      inside. Peter Ruff, without hesitation, pushed the door softly open and
      entered, replaced the footstool in its former position, and stood with his
      back to the wall, in the darkest corner of the hall, looking around him&mdash;listening
      intently. Nearly opposite the door of a room stood ajar. It was apparently
      lit up, but there was no sound of any one moving inside. Upstairs, in one
      of the rooms on the first floor, he could hear light footsteps&mdash;a
      woman&rsquo;s voice humming a song. He listened to the first few bars, and
      understanding became easier. Those first few bars were the opening ones of
      the Servian national anthem!
    </p>
    <p>
      With an effort, Peter Ruff concentrated his thoughts upon the immediate
      present. The little lady was upstairs. The servants had apparently retired
      for the night. He crept up to the half-open door and peered in. The room,
      as he had hoped to find it, was empty, but Madame&rsquo;s easy-chair was drawn
      up to the fire, and some coffee stood upon the hob. Stealthily Peter Ruff
      crept in and glanced around, seeking for a hiding place. A movement
      upstairs hastened his decision. He pushed aside the massive curtains which
      separated this from a connecting room. He had scarcely done so when light
      footsteps were heard descending the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff found his hiding place all that could have been desired. This
      secondary room itself was almost in darkness, but he was just able to
      appreciate the comforting fact that it possessed a separate exit into the
      hall. Through the folds of the curtain he had a complete view of the
      further apartment. The little lady had changed her gown of stiff white
      satin for one of flimsier material, and, seated in the easy-chair, she was
      busy pouring herself out some coffee. She took a cigarette from a silver
      box, and lighting it, curled herself up in the chair and composed herself
      as though to listen. To her as well as to Peter Ruff, as he crouched in
      his hiding place, the moments seemed to pass slowly enough. Yet, as he
      realised afterward, it could not have been ten minutes before she sat
      upright in a listening attitude. There was some one coming! Peter Ruff,
      too, heard a man&rsquo;s firm footsteps come up the flagged stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little lady sprang to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Jermyn came slowly to meet her. He seemed a little out of breath. His
      tie was all disarranged and his collar unfastened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little lady, however, noticed none of these things. She looked only
      into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got it?&rdquo; she asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust his hand into his breast-coat pocket, and held an envelope out
      toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I promised!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little sob, and with the packet in her hand came running
      straight toward the spot where Peter Ruff was hiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrank back as far as possible. She stopped just short of the curtain,
      opened the drawer of a table which stood there, and slipped the packet in.
      Then she came back once more to where Paul Jermyn was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend!&rdquo; she cried, holding out her hands&mdash;&ldquo;my dear, dear friend!
      Shall I ever be able to thank you enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if you try,&rdquo; he answered, smiling, &ldquo;I think that you could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand upon his arm&mdash;a little caressing, foreign gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how did you manage it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We left the dance together,&rdquo; Jermyn said. &ldquo;I could see that he wanted to
      get rid of me, but I offered to take him in my motor car. I told the man
      to choose some back streets, and while we were passing through one of
      them, I took Von Hern by the throat. We had a struggle, of course, but I
      got the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do with Von Hern?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left him on his doorstep,&rdquo; the young American answered. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t
      really hurt, but he was only half conscious. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll bother
      any one to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear, brave man!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Paul, what am I to say to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here to ask,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t give me my
      answer at the ball. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll give it me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sprang apart. Ruff felt his nerves stiffen&mdash;felt himself
      constrained to hold even his breath as he widened a little the crack in
      the curtains. This was no stealthy entrance. The door had been flung open.
      Von Hern, his dress in wild disorder, pale as a ghost, and with a great
      bloodstain upon his cheek, stood confronting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have done with your love-making,&rdquo; he called out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble
      you to restore my property!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The electric light gleamed upon a small revolver which flashed out toward
      the young American. Paul Jermyn never hesitated for a moment. He seized
      the chair by his side and flung it at Von Hern. There was a shot, the
      crash of the falling chair, a cry from Jermyn, who never hesitated,
      however, in his rush. The two men closed. A second shot went harmlessly to
      the ceiling. The little lady stole away&mdash;stole softly across the room
      toward the table. She opened the drawer. Suddenly the blood in her veins
      was frozen into fear. From nowhere, it seemed to her, came a hand which
      held her wrists like iron!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; Peter Ruff whispered from behind the curtain, &ldquo;I am sorry to
      deprive you of it, but this is stolen property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her screams rang through the room. Even the two men released one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is gone! It is gone!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Some one was hiding in the room!
      Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sprang into the hall. The two men followed her. The front door was
      slammed. They heard flying footsteps outside. Von Hern was out first,
      clearing the little flight of steps in one bound. Across the road he saw a
      flying figure. A level stream of fire poured from his hand&mdash;twice,
      three times. But Peter Ruff never faltered. Round the corner he tore. The
      man had kept his word&mdash;the brougham was already moving slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump in, sir,&rdquo; the man cried. &ldquo;Throw yourself in. Never mind about the
      door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard the shouts behind. Peter Ruff did as he was bid, and sat upon
      the floor, raising himself gradually to the seat when they had turned
      another corner. Then he put his head out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to the Duchess of Montford&rsquo;s!&rdquo; he ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest of the guests had ceased to arrive&mdash;a few were already
      departing. It was an idle time, however, with the servants who loitered in
      the vestibules of Montford House, and they looked with curiosity upon this
      strange guest who arrived at five minutes to two, limping a little, and
      holding his left arm in his right hand. One footman on the threshold
      nearly addressed him, but the words were taken out of his mouth when he
      saw Lady Mary and her brother&mdash;the Honorable Maurice Sotherst&mdash;hasten
      forward to greet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff smiled upon them benignly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can take the paper out of my breast-coat pocket,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s fingers gripped it. Through Lady Mary&rsquo;s great
      thankfulness, however, the sudden fear came shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hurt!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;There is blood on your sleeve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a graze,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;Von Hern wasn&rsquo;t much good at a
      running target. Back to the ballroom, young man,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see
      who&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister came up the tented way into Montford House. He, too,
      wondered a little at the man whom he met on his way out, holding his left
      arm, and looking more as though he had emerged from a street fight than
      from the Duchess of Montford&rsquo;s ball. Peter Ruff went home smiling.

      CHAPTER VII. THE DEMAND OF THE DOUBLE-FOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was about this time that Peter Ruff found among his letters one morning
      a highly-scented little missive, addressed to him in a handwriting with
      which he had once been familiar. He looked at it for several moments
      before opening it. Even as the paper cutter slid through the top of the
      envelope, he felt that he had already divined the nature of its contents.

    <p>
      FRIVOLITY THEATRE
    </p>
    <p>
      March 10th
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR Mr. RUFF: I expect that you will be surprised to hear from me
      again, but I do hope that you will not be annoyed. I know that I behaved
      very horridly a little time ago, but it was not altogether my fault, and I
      have been more sorry for it than I can tell you&mdash;in fact, John and I
      have never been the same since, and for the present, at any rate, I have
      left him and gone on the stage. A lady whom I knew got me a place in the
      chorus here, and so far I like it immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Won&rsquo;t you come and meet me after the show to-morrow night, and I will tell
      you all about it? I should like so much to see you again.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff placed this letter in his breast-coat pocket, and withheld it
      from his secretary&rsquo;s notice. He felt, however, very little pleasure at the
      invitation it conveyed. He hesitated for some time, in fact, whether to
      accept it or not. Finally, after his modest dinner that evening, he bought
      a stall for the Frivolity and watched the piece. The girl he had come to
      see was there in the second row of the chorus, but she certainly did not
      look her best in the somewhat scant costume required by the part. She
      showed no signs whatever of any special ability&mdash;neither her dancing
      nor her singing seemed to entitle her to any consideration. She carried
      herself with a certain amount of self-consciousness, and her eyes seemed
      perpetually fixed upon the occupants of the stalls. Peter Ruff laid down
      his glasses with something between a sigh and a groan. There was something
      to him inexpressibly sad in the sight of his old sweetheart so
      transformed, so utterly changed from the prim, somewhat genteel young
      person who had accepted his modest advances with such ladylike diffidence.
      She seemed, indeed, to have lost those very gifts which had first
      attracted him. Nevertheless, he kept his appointment at the stage-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was among the first to come out, and she greeted him warmly&mdash;almost
      noisily. With her new profession, she seemed to have adopted a different
      and certainly more flamboyant deportment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d come to-night,&rdquo; she declared, with an arch look. &ldquo;I felt
      certain I saw you in the stalls. You are going to take me to supper,
      aren&rsquo;t you? Shall we go to the Milan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff assented without enthusiasm, handed her into a hansom, and took
      his place beside her. She wore a very large hat, untidily put on; some of
      the paint seemed still to be upon her face; her voice, too, seemed to have
      become louder, and her manner more assertive. There were obvious
      indications that she no longer considered brandy and soda an unladylike
      beverage. Peter Ruff was not pleased with himself or proud of his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take some wine?&rdquo; he suggested, after he had ordered, with a few
      hints from her, a somewhat extensive supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Champagne,&rdquo; she answered, decidedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got quite used to it,
      nowadays,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I could laugh to think how strange it tasted when
      you first took me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;why you have left your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he was dull and because he was cross,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and because
      the life down at Streatham was simply intolerable. I think it was a little
      your fault, too,&rdquo; she said, making eyes; at him across the table. &ldquo;You
      gave me a taste of what life was like outside Streatham, and I never
      forgot it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff did not respond&mdash;he led the conversation, indeed, into
      other channels. On the whole, the supper was scarcely a success. Maud, who
      was growing to consider herself something of a Bohemian, and who certainly
      looked for some touch of sentiment on the part of her old admirer, was
      annoyed by the quiet deference with which he treated her. She reproached
      him with it once, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t seem to want to be so friendly as you
      did! You haven&rsquo;t forgiven me yet, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I think that you have scarcely done a wise
      thing in leaving your husband. I cannot think that this life on the stage
      is good for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I never thought to have you preaching at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They finished their supper. Maud accepted a cigarette and did her best to
      change her companion&rsquo;s mood. She only alluded once more to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I could have stayed with him, anyhow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
      know, he&rsquo;s been put back&mdash;he only gets two pounds fifteen a week now.
      He couldn&rsquo;t expect me to live upon that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put back?&rdquo; Peter Ruff repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed to have a lot of bad luck this last year,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All his
      cases went wrong, and they don&rsquo;t think so much of him at Scotland Yard as
      they did. I am not sure that he hasn&rsquo;t begun to drink a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to hear it,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should be,&rdquo; she answered, bluntly. &ldquo;He was no friend
      of yours, nor isn&rsquo;t now. He may not be so dangerous as he was, but if ever
      you come across him, you take my tip and be careful. He means to do you a
      mischief some day, if he can. I am not sure,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that he doesn&rsquo;t
      believe that it was partly your fault about my leaving home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be sorry for him to think that,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;While we
      are upon the subject, can&rsquo;t you tell me exactly why your husband dislikes
      me so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one thing, because you have been up against him in several of his
      cases, and have always won.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, doubtfully, &ldquo;he seems to connect you in his mind,
      somehow, with a boy who was in love with me once&mdash;Mr. Spencer
      Fitzgerald&mdash;you know who I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He still has that in his mind, has he?&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;However, don&rsquo;t let us talk about him any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lights were being put out. Peter Ruff paid his bill and they rose
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down to the fiat for an hour or so,&rdquo; she begged, taking his arm. &ldquo;I
      have a dear little place with another girl&mdash;Carrie Pearce. I&rsquo;ll sing
      to you, if you like. Come down and have one drink, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you must excuse me. In some ways, I am very
      old-fashioned,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I never sit up late, and I hate music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just drive as far as the door with me, then,&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me,&rdquo; he said, handing her into the hansom. &ldquo;And, Maud,&rdquo;
       he added&mdash;&ldquo;if I may call you so&mdash;take my advice: give it up&mdash;go
      back to your husband and stick to him&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be better off in the
      long run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would have answered him scornfully, but there was something impressive
      in the crisp, clear words&mdash;in his expression, too, as he looked into
      her eyes. She threw herself back in a corner of the cab with an affected
      little laugh, and turned her head away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff walked back into the cloak-room for his coat and hat, and
      sighed softly to himself. It was the end of the one sentimental episode of
      his life!
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been the study of Peter Ruff&rsquo;s life, so far as possible, to
      maintain under all circumstances an equable temperament, to refuse to
      recognize the meaning of the word &ldquo;nerves,&rdquo; and to be guided in all his
      actions by that profound common sense which was one of his natural gifts.
      Yet there were times when, like any other ordinary person, he suffered
      acutely from presentiments. He left his rooms, for instance, at five
      o&rsquo;clock on the afternoon of the day following his supper with Maud,
      suffering from a sense of depression for which he found it altogether
      impossible to account. It was true that the letter which he had in his
      pocket, the appointment which he was on his way to keep, were both of them
      probable sources of embarrassment and annoyance, if not of danger. He was
      being invited, without the option of refusal, to enter upon some risky
      undertaking which would yield him neither fee nor reward. Yet his common
      sense told him that it was part of the game. In Paris, he had looked upon
      his admittance into the order of the &ldquo;Double-Four&rdquo; as one of the
      stepping-stones to success in his career. Through them he had gained
      knowledge which he could have acquired in no other way. Through them, for
      instance, he had acquired the information that Madame la Comtesse de
      Pilitz was a Servian patriot and a friend of the Crown Prince; and that
      the Count von Hern, posing in England as a sportsman and an idler, was a
      highly paid and dangerous Austrian spy. There had been other occasions,
      too, upon which they had come to his aid. Now they had made an appeal to
      him&mdash;an appeal which must be obeyed. His time&mdash;perhaps, even,
      his safety&mdash;must be placed entirely at their disposal. It was only an
      ordinary return a thing expected of him&mdash;a thing which he dared not
      refuse. Yet he knew very well what he could not explain to them&mdash;that
      the whole success of his life depended so absolutely upon his remaining
      free from any suspicion of wrong-doing, that he had received his summons
      with something like dismay, and proceeded to obey it with unaccustomed
      reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove to Cirey&rsquo;s cafe in Regent Street, where he dismissed the driver
      of his hansom and strolled in with the air of an habitue. He selected a
      corner table, ordered some refreshment, and asked for a box of dominoes.
      The place was fairly well filled. A few women were sitting about; a
      sprinkling of Frenchmen were taking their aperitif; here and there a man
      of affairs, on his way from the city, had called in for a glass of
      vermouth. Peter Ruff looked them over, recognizing the type&mdash;recognizing,
      even, some of their faces. Apparently, the person whom he was to meet had
      not yet arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lit a cigarette and smoked slowly. Presently the door opened and a
      woman entered in a long fur coat, a large hat, and a thick veil. She
      raised it to glance around, disclosing the unnaturally pale face and dark,
      swollen eyes of a certain type of Frenchwoman. She seemed to notice no one
      in particular. Her eyes traveled over Peter Ruff without any sign of
      interest. Nevertheless, she took a seat somewhere near his and ordered
      some vermouth from the waiter, whom she addressed by name. When she had
      been served and the waiter had departed, she looked curiously at the
      dominoes which stood before her neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur plays dominoes, perhaps?&rdquo; she remarked, taking one of them into
      her fingers and examining it. &ldquo;A very interesting game!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff showed her a domino which he had been covering with his hand&mdash;it
      was a double four. She nodded, and moved from her seat to one immediately
      next him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not imagined,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;that it was a lady whom I was to
      meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is not disappointed, I trust?&rdquo; she said, smiling. &ldquo;If I talk
      banalities, Monsieur must pardon it. Both the waiters here are spies, and
      there are always people who watch. Monsieur is ready to do us a service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the limits of my ability,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;Madame will remember
      that we are not in Paris; that our police system, if not so wonderful as
      yours, is still a closer and a more present thing. They have not the
      brains at Scotland Yard, but they are persistent&mdash;hard to escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I not know it?&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;It is through them that we send for
      you. One of us is in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know him?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is doubtful,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Monsieur&rsquo;s stay in Paris was so brief. If
      Monsieur will recognize his name&mdash;it is Jean Lemaitre himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff started slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he said, with some hesitation, &ldquo;that Lemaitre did not visit
      this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came well disguised,&rdquo; the woman answered. &ldquo;It was thought to be safe.
      Nevertheless, it was a foolish thing. They have tracked him down from
      hotel to apartments, till he lives now in the back room of a wretched
      little cafe in Soho. Even from there we cannot get him away&mdash;the
      whole district is watched by spies. We need help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a genius like Lemaitre,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;to have even
      thought of Soho, was foolish. He should have gone to Hampstead or Balham.
      It is easy to fool our police if you know how. On the other hand, they
      hang on to the scent like leeches when once they are on the trail. How
      many warrants are there out against Jean in this country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not ask that,&rdquo; the woman said, grimly. &ldquo;You remember the raid on a
      private house in the Holloway Road, two years ago, when two policemen were
      shot and a spy was stabbed? Jean was in that&mdash;it is sufficient!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are any plans made at all?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But naturally,&rdquo; the woman answered. &ldquo;There is a motor car, even now, of
      sixty-horse-power, stands ready at a garage in Putney. If Jean can once
      reach it, he can reach the coast. At a certain spot near Southampton there
      is a small steamer waiting. After that, everything is easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My task, then,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;is to take Jean Lemaitre
      from this cafe in Soho, as far as Putney, and get him a fair start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;There is a cordon of spies around the
      district. Every day they seem to chose in upon us. They search the houses,
      one by one. Only last night, the Hotel de Netherlands&mdash;a miserable
      little place on the other side of the street&mdash;was suddenly surrounded
      by policemen and every room ransacked. It may be our turn to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one hour&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, glancing at his watch, &ldquo;I shall
      present myself as a doctor at the cafe. Tell me the address. Tell me what
      to say which will insure my admission to Jean Lemaitre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cafe,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;is called the Hotel de Flandres. You enter the
      restaurant and you walk to the desk. There you find always Monsieur
      Antoine. You say to him simply&mdash;&lsquo;The Double-Four!&rsquo; He will answer
      that he understands, and he will conduct you at once to Lemaitre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let it be understood in the cafe&mdash;if
      there is any one who is not in the secret&mdash;that one of the waiters is
      sick. I shall come to attend him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well that way as any other,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Monsieur is very kind. A
      bientot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook hands and they parted. Peter Ruff drove back to his rooms, rang
      up an adjoining garage for a small covered car such as are usually let out
      to medical men, and commenced to pack a small black bag with the outfit
      necessary for his purpose. Now that he was actually immersed in his work,
      the sense of depression had passed away. The keen stimulus of danger had
      quickened his blood. He knew very well that the woman had not exaggerated.
      There was no man more wanted by the French or the English police than the
      man who had sought his aid, and the district in which he had taken shelter
      was, in some respects, the very worst for his purpose. Nevertheless, Peter
      Ruff, who believed, at the bottom of his heart, in his star, went on with
      his preparations feeling morally certain that Jean Lemaitre would sleep on
      the following night in his native land.
    </p>
    <p>
      At precisely the hour agreed upon, a small motor brougham pulled up
      outside the door of the Hotel de Flandres and its occupant&mdash;whom
      ninety-nine men out of a hundred would at once, unhesitatingly, have
      declared to be a doctor in moderate practice&mdash;pushed open the swing
      doors of the restaurant and made his way to the desk. He was of medium
      height; he wore a frock-coat&mdash;a little frayed; gray trousers which
      had not been recently pressed; and thick boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that one of your waiters requires my attendance,&rdquo; he said,
      in a tone not unduly raised but still fairly audible. &ldquo;I am Dr. Gilette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Gilette,&rdquo; Antoine repeated, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And number Double-Four,&rdquo; the doctor murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antoine descended from his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But certainly, Monsieur!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The poor fellow declares that he
      suffers. If he is really ill, he must go. It sounds brutal, but what can
      one do? We have so few rooms here, and so much business. Monsieur will
      come this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antoine led the way from the cafe into a very smelly region of narrow
      passages and steep stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to be arranged?&rdquo; Antoine whispered, as they ascended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt,&rdquo; the doctor answered. &ldquo;Were there spies in the cafe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two,&rdquo; Antoine answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor nodded, and said no more. He mounted to the third story.
      Antoine led him through a small sitting-room and knocked four times upon
      the door of an inner room. It suddenly was opened. A man&mdash;unshaven,
      terrified, with that nameless fear in his face which one sees reflected in
      the expression of some trapped animal&mdash;stood there looking out at
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Double-Four&rsquo;!&rdquo; the doctor said, softly. &ldquo;Go back into the room, please.
      Antoine will kindly leave us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the man gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Double-Four&rsquo;!&rdquo; the doctor answered. &ldquo;Obey me, and be quick for your
      life! Strip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barely twenty minutes later, the doctor&mdash;still carrying his bag&mdash;descended
      the stairs. He entered the cafe from a somewhat remote door. Antoine
      hurried to meet him, and walked by his side through the place. He asked
      many questions, but the doctor contented himself with shaking his head.
      Almost in silence he left Antoine, who conducted him even to the door of
      his motor. The proprietor of the cafe watched the brougham disappear, and
      then returned to his desk, sighing heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man who had been sipping a liqueur dose at hand, laid down his paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of your waiters ill, did I understand?&rdquo; he asked. Monsieur Antoine
      was at once eloquent. It was the ill-fortune which had dogged him for the
      last four months! The man had been taken ill there in the restaurant. He
      was a Gascon&mdash;spoke no English&mdash;and had just arrived. It was not
      possible for him to be removed at the moment, so he had been carried to an
      empty bedroom. Then had come the doctor and forbidden his removal. Now for
      a week he had lain there and several of his other voyageurs had departed.
      One did not know how these things got about, but they spoke of infection.
      The doctor, who had just left&mdash;Dr. Gilette of Russell Square, a most
      famous physician&mdash;had assured him that there was no infection&mdash;no
      fear of any. But what did it matter&mdash;that? People were so hard to
      convince. Monsieur would like a cigar? But certainly! There were here some
      of the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antoine undid the cabinet and opened a box of Havanas. John Dory selected
      one and called for another liqueur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have trouble often with your waiters, I dare say,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;They
      tell me that all Frenchmen who break the law in their own country, find
      their way, sooner or later, to these parts. You have to take them without
      characters, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antoine lifted his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what could one do?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Characters, they were easy enough
      to write&mdash;but were they worth the paper they were written on? Indeed
      no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only your waiters,&rdquo; Dory continued, &ldquo;but those who stay in the hotels
      round here have sometimes an evil name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antoine shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am particular. We have but a few rooms, but we
      are careful to whom we let them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you keep a visitors&rsquo; book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no, Monsieur!&rdquo; Antoine protested. &ldquo;For why the necessity? There are
      so few who come to stay for more than the night&mdash;just now scarcely
      any one at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There entered, at that moment, a tall, thin man dressed in dark clothes,
      who walked with his hands in his overcoat pockets, as though it were a
      habit. He came straight to Dory and handed him a piece of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Dory glanced it through and rose to his feet. A gleam of satisfaction
      lit his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Antoine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am sorry to cause you any inconvenience,
      but here is my card. I am a detective officer from Scotland Yard, and I
      have received information which compels me with your permission, to
      examine at once the sleeping apartments in your hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antoine was fiercely indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Monsieur!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I do not understand! Examine my rooms? But
      it is impossible! Who dares to say that I harbor criminals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have information upon which I can rely,&rdquo; John Dory answered, firmly.
      &ldquo;This comes from a man who is no friend of mine, but he is well-known. You
      can read for yourself what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Antoine, with trembling fingers, took the piece of paper from
      John Dory&rsquo;s hands. It was addressed to&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. JOHN DORY, DETECTIVE:
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to find Jean Lemaitre, search in the upper rooms of the Hotel
      de Flandres. I have certain information that he is to be found there.
    </p>
    <p>
      PETER RUFF.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; Antoine declared, &ldquo;will I suffer such an indignity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dory raised a police whistle to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are foolish,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Already there is a cordon of men about the
      place. If you refuse to conduct me upstairs I shall at once place you
      under arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antoine, white with fear, poured himself out a liqueur of brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what must be done, then! Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way out into that smelly network of passages, up the stairs to
      the first floor. Room after room he threw open and begged Dory to examine.
      Some of them were garishly furnished with gilt mirrors, cheap lace
      curtains tied back with blue ribbons. Others were dark, miserable holes,
      into which the fresh air seemed never to have penetrated. On the third
      floor they reached the little sitting-room, which bore more traces of
      occupation than some of the rooms below. Antoine would have passed on, but
      Dory stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a door there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We will try that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the sick waiter who lies within,&rdquo; Antoine protested. &ldquo;Monsieur can
      hear him groan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was, indeed, something which sounded like a groan to be heard, but
      Dory was obstinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is so ill,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;how is he able to lock the door on the
      inside? Monsieur Antoine, that door must be opened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antoine knocked at it softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francois,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is another doctor here who would see you. Let
      us in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer, Antoine turned to his companion with a little shrug
      of the shoulders, as one who would say&mdash;&ldquo;I have done my best. What
      would you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dory put his shoulder to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he shouted through the keyhole, &ldquo;Mr. Sick Waiter, or whoever you
      are, if you do not unlock this door, I am coming in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no key,&rdquo; said a faint voice. &ldquo;I am locked in. Please break open
      the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is not the Voice of Francois!&rdquo; Antoine exclaimed, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon see who it is,&rdquo; Dory answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He charged at the door fiercely. At the third assault it gave way. They
      found themselves in a small back bedroom, and stretched on the floor, very
      pale, and apparently only half-conscious, lay Peter Ruff. There was a
      strong smell of chloroform about. John Dory threw open the window. His
      fingers trembled a little. It was like Fate&mdash;this! At the end of
      every unsuccessful effort there was this man&mdash;Peter Ruff!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help me up,&rdquo; he begged, &ldquo;and give me a little brandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antoine set him in an easy-chair and rang the bell furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will come directly!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;But who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff waited for the brandy. When he had sipped it, he drew a little
      breath as though of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard,&rdquo; he said, speaking still with an evident effort, &ldquo;that Lemaitre
      was here. I had secret information. I thought at first that I would let
      you know&mdash;I sent you a note early this morning. Afterwards, I
      discovered that there was a reward, and I determined to track him down
      myself. He was in here hiding as a sick waiter. I do not think,&rdquo; Peter
      Ruff added, &ldquo;that Monsieur Antoine had any idea. I presented myself as
      representing a charitable society, and I was shown here to visit him. He
      was too clever, though, was Jean Lemaitre&mdash;too quick for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were a fool to come alone!&rdquo; John Dory said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the man&rsquo;s
      record? How long ago did he leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About ten minutes,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;You must have missed him
      somewhere as you came up. I crawled to the window and I watched him go. He
      left the restaurant by the side entrance, and took a taxicab at the corner
      there. It went northward toward New Oxford Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dory turned on his heel&mdash;they heard him descending the stairs. Peter
      Ruff rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, as he plunged his head into a basin of water, and
      came into the middle of the room rubbing it vigorously with a small towel,
      &ldquo;I am afraid that our friend John Dory will get to dislike me soon! He
      passed out unnoticed, eh, Antoine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antoine&rsquo;s face wore a look of great relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was not a soul who looked,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We passed under the nose of
      the gentleman from Scotland Yard. He sat there reading his paper; and he
      had no idea. I watched Jean step into the motor. Even by now he is well on
      his way southwards. Twice he changes from motor to train, and back. They
      will never trace him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff, who was looking amazingly better, sipped a further glass of
      liqueur. Together he and Antoine descended to the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; Peter Ruff whispered, &ldquo;I consider that accounts are squared
      between me and &lsquo;Double-Four&rsquo; now. Let them know that. This sort of thing
      isn&rsquo;t in my line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For an amateur,&rdquo; Antoine said, bowing low, &ldquo;Monsieur commands my
      heartfelt congratulations!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. Mrs. BOGNOR&rsquo;S STAR BOARDER
    </h2>
    <p>
      In these days, the duties of Miss Brown as Peter Ruff&rsquo;s secretary had
      become multifarious. Together with the transcribing of a vast number of
      notes concerning cases, some of which he undertook and some of which he
      refused, she had also to keep his cash book, a note of his investments and
      a record of his social engagements. Notwithstanding all these demands upon
      her time, however, there were occasions when she found herself, of
      necessity, idle. In one of these she broached the subject which had often
      been in her mind. They were alone, and not expecting callers.
      Consequently, she sat upon the hearthrug and addressed her employer by his
      Christian name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;do you remember the night when you came through
      the fog and burst into my little flat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but it is a subject to which I prefer that you
      do not allude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be careful,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I only spoke of it for this reason.
      Before you left, when we were sitting together, you sketched out the
      career which you proposed for yourself. In many respects, I suppose, you
      have been highly successful, but I wonder if it has ever occurred to you
      that your work has not proceeded upon the lines which you first
      indicated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know what you mean,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That night,&rdquo; she murmured softly, &ldquo;you spoke as a hunted man; you spoke
      as one at war with Society; you spoke as one who proposes almost a
      campaign against it. When you took your rooms here and called yourself
      Peter Ruff, it was rather in your mind to aid the criminal than to detect
      the crime. Fate seems to have decreed otherwise. Why, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things have gone that way,&rdquo; Peter Ruff remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you why,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;It is because, at the bottom of
      your heart, there lurks a strong and unconquerable desire for
      respectability. In your heart you are on the side of the law and
      established things. You do not like crime; you do not like criminals. You
      do not like the idea of associating with them. You prefer the company of
      law-abiding people, even though their ways be narrow. It was part of that
      sentiment, Peter, which led you to fall in love with a coal-merchant&rsquo;s
      daughter. I can see that you will end your days in the halo of
      respectability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff was a little thoughtful. He scratched his chin and contemplated
      the tip of his faultless patent boot. Self-analysis interested him, and he
      recognized the truth of the girl&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, I am rather like that,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;When I see a family
      party, I envy them. When I hear of a man who has brothers and sisters and
      aunts and cousins, and gives family dinner-parties to family friends, I
      envy him. I do not care about the loose ends of life. I do not care about
      restaurant life, and ladies who transfer their regards with the same
      facility that they change their toilettes. You have very admirable powers
      of observation, Violet. You see me, I believe, as I really am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That being so,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;what are you going to say to Sir Richard
      Dyson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff was frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to make up your mind very soon,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;He is
      coming here at twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall wait until I hear what he has to say,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His letter gave you a pretty clear hint,&rdquo; Violet said, &ldquo;that it was
      something outside the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law has many outposts,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;One can thread one&rsquo;s way in
      and out, if one knows the ropes. I don&rsquo;t like the man, but he introduced
      me to his tailor. I have never had any clothes like those he has made me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a vain little person,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an impertinent young woman!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Get back to your work.
      Don&rsquo;t you hear the lift stop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose reluctantly, and resumed her place in front of her desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s risky,&rdquo; she whispered, leaning round towards him, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you take
      it on. I&rsquo;ve heard one or two things about Sir Richard lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded. He, too, quitted his easy-chair, and took up a bundle
      of papers which lay upon his desk. There was a sharp tap at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard Dyson entered. He was dressed quietly, but with the perfect
      taste which was obviously an instinct with him, and he wore a big bunch of
      violets in his buttonhole. Nevertheless, the spring sunshine seemed to
      find out the lines in his face. His eyes were baggy&mdash;he had aged even
      within the last few months.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Ruff,&rdquo; he said, shaking hands, &ldquo;how goes it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very well, Sir Richard,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;Please take a chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard took the easy-chair, and discovering a box of cigarettes upon
      the table, helped himself. Then his eyes fell upon Miss Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do without your secretary?&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;As I told you before, I am her
      guarantee that what you say to me, or before her, is spoken as though to
      the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as well,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;for I am going to talk about a man who I
      wish were dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are few of us,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;who have not our enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any experience of blackmailers?&rdquo; Sir Richard asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my profession,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered, &ldquo;I have come across such
      persons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to see you about one,&rdquo; Sir Richard proceeded. &ldquo;Many years
      ago, there was a fellow in my regiment who went to the bad&mdash;never
      mind his name. He passes to-day as Ted Jones&mdash;that name will do as
      well as another. I am not,&rdquo; Sir Richard continued, &ldquo;a good-natured man,
      but some devilish impulse prompted me to help that fellow. I gave him
      money three or four times. Somehow, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a very good thing
      to give a man money. He doesn&rsquo;t value it&mdash;it comes too easily. He
      spends it and wants more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal of truth in what you say, Sir Richard,&rdquo; Peter Ruff
      admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend, for instance, wanted more,&rdquo; Sir Richard continued. &ldquo;He came
      to me for it almost as a matter of course. I refused. He came again; I
      lost my temper and punched his head. Then his little game began.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had something to work upon, I suppose?&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly he had,&rdquo; Sir Richard admitted. &ldquo;If ever I achieved
      sufficient distinction in any branch of life to make it necessary that my
      biography should be written, I promise you that you would find it in many
      places a little highly colored. In other words, Mr. Ruff, I have not
      always adhered to the paths of righteousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint smile flickered across Peter Ruff&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Richard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your candor is admirable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was one time,&rdquo; Sir Richard continued, &ldquo;when I was really on my last
      legs. It was just before I came into the baronetcy. I had borrowed every
      penny I could borrow. I was even hard put to it for a meal. I went to
      Paris, and I called myself by another man&rsquo;s name. I got introduced to a
      somewhat exclusive club there. My assumed name was a good one&mdash;it was
      the name, in fact, of a relative whom I somewhat resembled. I was accepted
      without question. I played cards, and I lost somewhere about eighteen
      thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sum,&rdquo; Peter Ruff remarked, &ldquo;which you probably found it inconvenient to
      pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was only one course,&rdquo; Sir Richard continued, &ldquo;and I took it. I went
      back the next night and gave checks for the amount of my indebtedness&mdash;checks
      which had no more chance of being met than if I were to draw to-night upon
      the Bank of England for a million pounds. I went back, however, with
      another resolve. I was considered to have discharged my liabilities, and
      we played again. I rose a winner of something like sixty thousand francs.
      But I played to win, Mr. Ruff! Do you know what that means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cheated!&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; Sir Richard admitted. &ldquo;I cheated! There was a scandal, and I
      disappeared. I had the money, and though my checks for the eighteen
      thousand francs were met, there was a considerable balance in my pocket
      when I escaped out of France. There was enough to take me out to America&mdash;big
      game shooting in the far West. No one ever associated me with the impostor
      who had robbed these young French noblemen&mdash;no one, that is to say,
      except the person who passes by the name of Teddy Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he get to know?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The story wouldn&rsquo;t interest you,&rdquo; Sir Richard answered. &ldquo;He was in Paris
      at the time&mdash;we came across one another twice. He heard the scandal,
      and put two and two together. I shipped him off to Australia when I came
      into the title. He has come back. Lately, I can tell you, he has pretty
      well drained me dry. He has become a regular parasite a cold-blooded
      leech. He doesn&rsquo;t get drunk now. He looks after his health. I believe he
      even saves his, money. There&rsquo;s scarcely a week I don&rsquo;t hear from him. He
      keeps me a pauper. He has brought me at last to that state when I feel
      that there must be an ending!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come to seek my help,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, slowly. &ldquo;From what you
      say about this man, I presume that he is not to be frightened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a single moment,&rdquo; Sir Richard answered. &ldquo;The law has no terrors
      for him. He is as slippery as an eel. He has his story pat. He even has
      his witnesses ready. I can assure you that Mr. Teddy Jones isn&rsquo;t by any
      means an ordinary sort of person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not to be bluffed,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, slowly; &ldquo;he is not to be
      bribed. What remains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come here,&rdquo; Sir Richard said, &ldquo;for your advice, Mr. Ruff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blackmailer,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;is a criminal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a scoundrel!&rdquo; Sir Richard assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not fit to live,&rdquo; Peter Ruff repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He contaminates the world with every breath he draws!&rdquo; Sir Richard
      assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;you had better give me his address, and the
      name he goes under.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives at a boarding-house in Russell Street, Bloomsbury,&rdquo; Sir Richard
      said. &ldquo;It is Mrs. Bognor&rsquo;s boarding-house. She calls it, I believe, the
      &lsquo;American Home from Home.&rsquo; The number is 17.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A boarding-house,&rdquo; Peter Ruff repeated, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Makes it a little
      hard to get at him privately, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fling him a bait and he will come to you,&rdquo; Sir Richard answered. &ldquo;He is
      an adventurer pure and simple, though perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t believe it to
      look at him now. He has grown fat on the money he has wrung from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better leave the matter in my hands for a few days,&rdquo; Peter Ruff
      said. &ldquo;I will have a talk with this gentleman and see whether he is really
      so unmanageable. If he is, there is, of course, only one way, and for that
      way, Sir Richard, you would have to pay a little high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were to hear to-morrow,&rdquo; Sir Richard said quietly, &ldquo;that Teddy Jones
      was dead, I would give five thousand pounds to the man who brought me the
      information!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be worth that,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;quite! I will drop you a line in
      the course of the next few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard took up his hat, lit another of Peter Ruff&rsquo;s cigarettes, and
      departed. They heard the rattle of the lift as it descended. Then Miss
      Brown turned round in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it, Peter!&rdquo; she said solemnly. &ldquo;The time has gone by for
      that sort of thing. The man may be unfit to live, but you don&rsquo;t need to
      risk as much as that for a matter of five thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;quite right, Violet. At the same time, five
      thousand pounds is an excellent sum. We must see what can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff&rsquo;s method of seeing what could be done was at first the very
      obvious one of seeking to discover any incidents in the past of the person
      known as Teddy Jones likely to reflect present discredit upon him if
      brought to light. From the first, it was quite clear that the career of
      this gentleman had been far from immaculate. His researches proved, beyond
      a doubt, that the gentleman in question had resorted, during the last ten
      or fifteen years, to many and very questionable methods of obtaining a
      living. At the same time, there was nothing which Peter Ruff felt that the
      man might not brazen out. His present mode of life seemed&mdash;on the
      surface, at any rate&mdash;to be beyond reproach. There was only one
      association which was distinctly questionable, and it was in this one
      direction, therefore, that Peter Ruff concentrated himself. The case, for
      some reason, interested him so much that he took a close and personal
      interest in it, and he was rewarded one day by discovering this enemy of
      Sir Richard&rsquo;s sitting, toward five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, in a cafe in
      Regent Street, engrossed in conversation with a person whom Peter Ruff
      knew to be a very black sheep indeed&mdash;a man who had been tried for
      murder, and concerning whom there were still many unpleasant rumors. From
      behind his paper in a corner of the cafe, Peter Ruff watched these two
      men. Teddy Jones&mdash;or Major Edward Jones, as it seemed he was now
      called&mdash;was a person whose appearance no longer suggested the poverty
      against which he had been struggling most of his life. He was well dressed
      and tolerably well turned out. His face was a little puffy, and he had put
      on flesh during these days of his ease. His eyes, too, had a somewhat
      furtive expression, although his general deportment was one of
      braggadocio. Peter Ruff, quick always in his likes or dislikes, found the
      man repulsive from the start. He felt that he would have a genuine
      pleasure, apart from the matter of the five thousand pounds, in
      accelerating Major Jones&rsquo;s departure from a world which he certainly did
      not adorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men conducted their conversation in a subdued tone, which made it
      quite impossible for Peter Ruff, in his somewhat distant corner, to
      overhear a single word of it. It was obvious, however, that they were not
      on the best of terms. Major Jones&rsquo;s companion was protesting, and
      apparently without success, against some course of action or speech of his
      companions. The conversation, on the other hand, never reached a quarrel,
      and the two men left the place together apparently on ordinary terms of
      friendliness. Peter Ruff at once quitted his seat and crossed the room
      toward the spot where they had been sitting. He dived under the table and
      picked up a newspaper&mdash;it was the only clue left to him as to the
      nature of their conversation. More than once, Major Jones who had, soon
      after their arrival, sent a waiter for it, had pointed to a certain
      paragraph as though to give weight to his statements. Peter Ruff had
      noticed the exact position of that paragraph. He smoothed out the paper
      and found it at once. It was an account of the murder of a wealthy old
      woman, living on the outskirts of a country village not far from London.
      Peter Ruff&rsquo;s face did not change as he called for another vermouth and
      read the description, slowly. Yet he was aware that he had possibly
      stumbled across the very thing for which he had searched so urgently! The
      particulars of the murder he already knew well, as at one time he had felt
      inclined to aid the police in their so far fruitless investigations. He
      therefore skipped the description of the tragedy, and devoted his
      attention to the last paragraph, toward which he fancied that the finger
      of Major Jones had been chiefly directed. It was a list of the stolen
      property, which consisted of jewelry, gold and notes to a very
      considerable amount. With the waiter&rsquo;s permission, he annexed the paper,
      cut out the list of articles with a sharp penknife, and placed it in his
      pocketbook before he left the cafe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of some of the smaller cases with which Peter Ruff had been
      from time to time connected, he had more than once come into contact with
      the authorities at Scotland Yard, and he had several acquaintances there&mdash;not
      including Mr. John Dory&mdash;to whom, at times, he had given valuable
      information. For the first time, he now sought some return for his many
      courtesies. He drove straight from the cafe to the office of the Chief of
      the Criminal Investigation Department. The questions he asked there were
      only two, but they were promptly and courteously answered. Peter Ruff left
      the building and drove back to his rooms in a somewhat congratulatory
      frame of mind. After all, it was chance which was the chief factor in the
      solution of so many of these cases! Often he had won less success after
      months of untiring effort than he had gained during that few minutes in
      the cafe in Regent Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff became an inmate of that very select boarding-house carried on
      by Mrs. Bognor at number 17 Russell Street, Bloomsbury. He arrived with a
      steamer trunk, an elaborate traveling-bag and a dressing-case; took the
      best vacant room in the house, and dressed for dinner. Mrs. Bognor looked
      upon him as a valuable addition to her clientele, and introduced him
      freely to her other guests. Among these was Major Edward Jones. Major
      Jones sat at Mrs. Bognor&rsquo;s right hand, and was evidently the show guest of
      the boarding-house. Peter Ruff, without the least desire to attack his
      position, sat upon her left and monopolized the conversation. On the third
      night it turned, by chance, upon precious stones. Peter Ruff drew a little
      chamois leather bag from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that my tastes are peculiar. I have been in the
      East, and I have seen very many precious stones in their uncut state. To
      my mind, there is nothing to be compared with opals. These are a few I
      brought home from India. Perhaps you would like to look at them, Mrs.
      Bognor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were passed round, amidst a little chorus of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The large one with the blue fire,&rdquo; Peter Ruff remarked, &ldquo;is, I think,
      remarkably beautiful. I have never seen a stone quite like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wonderful!&rdquo; murmured the young lady who was sitting at Major
      Jones&rsquo;s right hand. &ldquo;What a fortunate man you are, Mr. Ruff, to have such
      a collection of treasures!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff bowed across the table. Major Jones, who was beginning to feel
      that his position as show guest was in danger, thrust his hand into his
      waistcoat pocket and produced a lady&rsquo;s ring, in which was set a single
      opal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very pretty stones,&rdquo; he remarked carelessly, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t say I am very
      fond of them. Here&rsquo;s one that belonged to my sister, and my grandmother
      before her. I have it in my pocket because I was thinking of having the
      stone reset and making a present of it to a friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff&rsquo;s popularity waned&mdash;he had said nothing about making a
      present to any one of even the most insignificant of his opals! And the
      one which Major Jones now handed round was certainly a magnificent stone.
      Peter Ruff examined it with the rest, and under the pretext of studying
      the setting, gazed steadfastly at the inside through his eyeglass. Major
      Jones, from the other side of the table, frowned, and held out his hand
      for the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very beautiful stone indeed!&rdquo; Peter Ruff declared, passing it across
      the tablecloth. &ldquo;Really, I do not think that there is one in my little
      collection to be compared with it. Have you many treasures like this,
      Major Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a few!&rdquo; the Major answered carelessly, &ldquo;family heirlooms, most of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to give me the ring, Major Jones,&rdquo; the young lady on his
      right remarked archly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad luck, you know, to give it to any one who
      is not born in October, and my birthday is on the twelfth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Levey,&rdquo; Major Jones answered, whispering in her ear, &ldquo;more
      unlikely things have happened than that I should beg your acceptance of
      this little trifle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sooner or later,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said genially, &ldquo;I should like to have a
      little conversation with you, Major. I fancy that we ought to be able to
      find plenty of subjects of common interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo; the latter answered, utterly unsuspicious. &ldquo;Shall
      we go into the smoking-room now, or would you rather play a rubber first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is all the same to you,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;I think we will have a
      cigar first. There will be plenty of time for bridge afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I offer you a cigar, sir?&rdquo; Major Jones inquired, passing across a
      well-filled case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, Major,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there is scarcely time. You see, I
      have a warrant in my pocket for your arrest, and I am afraid that by the
      time we got to the station&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Major Jones leaned forward in his chair. He gripped the sides tightly with
      both hands. His eyes seemed to be protruding from his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my what?&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a tone of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your arrest,&rdquo; Peter Ruff explained calmly. &ldquo;Surely you must have been
      expecting it! During all these years you must have grown used to expecting
      it at every moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Major Jones collapsed. He looked at Ruff as one might look at a man who
      has taken leave of his senses. Yet underneath it all was the coward&rsquo;s
      fear!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about, man?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What do you mean? Lower
      your voice, for heaven&rsquo;s sake! Consider my position here! Some one might
      overhear! If this is a joke, let me tell you that it&rsquo;s a d&mdash;&mdash;d
      foolish one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to create a disturbance&mdash;my manner of
      coming here should have assured you of that. At the same time, business is
      business. I hold a warrant for your arrest, and I am forced to execute
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you are a detective, then?&rdquo; Major Jones demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a big man, but his voice seemed to have grown very small indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;I should not come here without
      authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the charge?&rdquo; the other man faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blackmail,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said slowly. &ldquo;The information against you is
      lodged by Sir Richard Dyson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Peter Ruff, who was watching his companion closely, that a
      wave of relief passed over the face of the man who sat cowering in his
      chair. He certainly drew a little gasp&mdash;stretched out his hands, as
      though to thrust the shadow of some fear from him. His voice, when he
      spoke, was stronger. Some faint show of courage was returning to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some ridiculous mistake,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Let us talk this over
      like sensible men, Mr. Ruff. If you will wait until I have spoken to Sir
      Richard, I can promise you that the warrant shall be withdrawn, and that
      you shall not be the loser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it is too late for anything of that sort,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said.
      &ldquo;Sir Richard&rsquo;s patience has been completely exhausted by your repeated
      demands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never told me so,&rdquo; Major Jones whined. &ldquo;I quite thought that he was
      always glad to help an old friend. As a matter of fact, I had not meant to
      ask him for anything else. The last few hundreds I had from him was to
      have closed the thing up. It was the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was not the end! It never would have been the end! Sir
      Richard sought my advice, and I gave it him without hesitation. Sooner or
      later, I told him, he would have to adopt different measures. I convinced
      him. I represent those measures!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the matter can be arranged,&rdquo; Major Jones insisted, with a little
      shudder, &ldquo;I am perfectly certain it can be arranged. Mr. Ruff, you are not
      an ordinary police officer&mdash;I am sure of that. Give me a chance of
      having an interview with Sir Richard before anything more is done. I will
      satisfy him, I promise you that. Why, if we leave the place together like
      this, every one here will get to know about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be reasonable,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;Of course everyone will get to know
      about it! Blackmailing cases always excite a considerable amount of
      interest. Your photograph will probably be in the Daily Mirror tomorrow or
      the next day. In the meantime, I must trouble you to pay your respects to
      Mrs. Bognor and to come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Sir Richard&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; Major Jones asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the police-stations,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Jones did not rise. He sat for a few moments with his head buried in
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ruff,&rdquo; he said hoarsely, &ldquo;listen to me. I have been fortunate lately
      in some investments. I am not so poor as I was. I have my check-book in my
      pocket, and a larger balance in the bank now than I have ever had before.
      If I write you a check for, say, a hundred&mdash;no, two!&mdash;five!&rdquo; he
      cried, desperately, watching Peter Ruff&rsquo;s unchanging face&mdash;&ldquo;five
      hundred pounds, will you come round with me to Sir Richard&rsquo;s house in a
      hansom at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five thousand pounds would not buy your liberty from me, Major Jones,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man became abject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have pity, then,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;My health is not good&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t
      stand imprisonment. Think of what it means to a man of my age suddenly to
      leave everything worth having in life just because he may have imposed a
      little on the generosity of a friend! Think how you would feel, and be
      merciful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head slowly. His face was immovable, but there was a
      look in his eyes from which the other man shrank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Jones,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you ask me be merciful. You appeal to my pity.
      For such as you I have no pity, nor have I ever shown any mercy. You know
      very well, and I know, that when once the hand of the law touches your
      shoulder, it will not be only a charge o&rsquo; blackmail which the police will
      bring against you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing else&mdash;nothing else!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Take half my
      fortune, Mr. Ruff. Let me get away. Give me a chance&mdash;just a sporting
      chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;what chance that poor old lady in Weston
      had? No, I am not saying you murdered her. You never had the pluck. Your
      confederate did that, and you handled the booty. What were the initials
      inside that ring you showed us to-night, Major Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go to my bedroom,&rdquo; he said, in a strange, far-away tone. &ldquo;You can
      come with me and stand outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save scandal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three flights of stairs they climbed. When at last they reached the door,
      the trembling man made one last appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ruff,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have a little mercy. Give me an hour&rsquo;s start&mdash;just
      a chance for my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff pushed him in the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a hard man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I keep my mercy for men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the key from the inside of the door, locked it, and with the key
      in his pocket descended to the drawing-room. The young lady who had sat on
      Major Jones&rsquo;s right was singing a ballad. Suddenly she paused in the
      middle of her song. The four people who were playing bridge looked up.
      Mrs. Bognor screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounded,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;very much like revolver shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Sir Richard remarked, with a queer look in his eyes, as he handed
      over a roll of notes to Peter Ruff, &ldquo;the jury brought it in &lsquo;Suicide&rsquo;!
      What I can&rsquo;t understand is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try,&rdquo; Peter Ruff interrupted briskly. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t in the bond that
      you should understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard helped himself to a drink. A great burden had passed from his
      shoulders, but he was not feeling at his best that morning. He could
      scarcely keep his eyes from Peter Ruff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruff,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have known you some time, and I have known you to be a
      square man. I have known you to do good-natured actions. I came to you in
      desperation but I scarcely expected this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff emptied his own tumbler and took up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Richard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are like a good many other people. Now that
      the thing is done, you shrink from the thought of it. You even wonder how
      I could have planned to bring about the death of this man. Listen, Sir
      Richard. Pity for the deserving, or for those who have in them one single
      quality, one single grain, of good, is a sentiment which deserves respect.
      Pity for vermin, who crawl about the world leaving a poisonous trail upon
      everything they touch, is a false and unnatural sentiment. For every
      hopelessly corrupt man who is induced to quit this life there is a more
      deserving one, somewhere or other, for whom the world is a better place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that, after all, you are a philanthropist, Mr. Ruff,&rdquo; Sir Richard
      said, with a forced smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A philosopher,&rdquo; he answered, buttoning up his notes.

      CHAPTER IX. THE PERFIDY OF MISS BROWN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff came down to his office with a single letter in his hand,
      bearing a French postmark. He returned his secretary&rsquo;s morning greeting a
      little absently, and seated himself at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;have you ever been to Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him compassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More times than you, I think, Peter,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;is very possible! Could you get ready to leave by
      the two-twenty this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, alone?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;with me,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shut down her desk with a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I can!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What a spree!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she caught sight of a certain expression on Peter Ruff&rsquo;s face, and
      she looked at him wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anything wrong, Peter?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I cannot say that anything is wrong. I have had an
      invitation to present myself before a certain society in Paris of which
      you have some indirect knowledge. What the summons means I cannot say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you go?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have no choice. If I waited here twenty-four
      hours, I should hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can have nothing against you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;On the contrary, the only
      time they have appealed for your aid, you gave it&mdash;very valuable aid
      it must have been, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;what they can have against me. And yet,
      somehow, the wording of my invitation seemed to me a little ominous.
      Perhaps,&rdquo; he added, walking to the window and standing looking out for a
      moment, &ldquo;I have a liver this morning. I am depressed. Violet, what does it
      mean when you are depressed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you wear your gray clothes for traveling?&rdquo; she asked, a little
      irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not made up my mind,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;I thought of wearing
      my brown, with a brown overcoat. What do you suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you in brown,&rdquo; she answered, simply. &ldquo;I should change, if I were
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you have a sort of superstition that as I
      change my clothes I change my humors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I be so very far wrong?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that I am
      laughing at you, Peter. The greatest men in the world have had their
      foibles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be away for several days,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Be sure that you take some
      wraps. It will be cold, crossing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to close the office altogether?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put up a notice,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Back on Friday.&rsquo; Pack up your books and
      take them round to the Bank before you leave. The lift man will call you a
      taxi-cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched her preparations with a sort of gloomy calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d tell me what is the matter with you?&rdquo; she asked, as she
      turned to follow her belongings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;I, suppose I am suffering from what you
      would call presentiments. Be at Charing-Cross punctually.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you go at all?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;These people are of no further use to
      you. Only the other day, you were saying that you should not accept any
      more outside cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;I am not afraid of many things, but I
      should be afraid of disobeying this letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had a comfortable journey down, a cool, bright crossing, and found
      their places duly reserved for them in the French train. Miss Brown, in
      her neat traveling clothes and furs, was conscious of looking her best,
      and she did all that was possible to entertain her traveling companion.
      But Peter Ruff seemed like a man who labors under some sense of
      apprehension. He had faced death more than once during the last few years&mdash;faced
      it without flinching, and with a certain cool disregard which can only
      come from the highest sort of courage. Yet he knew, when he read over
      again in the train that brief summons which he was on his way to obey,
      that he had passed under the shadow of some new and indefinable fear. He
      was perfectly well aware, too, that both on the steamer and on the French
      train he was carefully shadowed. This fact, however, did not surprise him.
      He even went out of his way to enter into conversation with one of the two
      men whose furtive glances into their compartment and whose constant
      proximity had first attracted his attention. The man was civil but vague.
      Nevertheless, when they took their places in the dining-car, they found
      the two men at the next table. Peter Ruff pointed them out to his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Double-Fours&rsquo;!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel like a criminal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and they took no more notice of the men. But as the train
      drew near Paris, he felt some return of the depression which had troubled
      him during the earlier part of the day. He felt a sense of comfort in his
      companion&rsquo;s presence which was a thing utterly strange to him. On the
      other hand, he was conscious of a certain regret that he had brought her
      with him into an adventure of which he could not foresee the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights of Paris flashed around them&mdash;the train was gradually
      slackening speed. Peter Ruff, with a sigh, began to collect their
      belongings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ought not to have brought you.&rdquo; Something in his
      voice puzzled her. There had been every few times, during all the years
      she had known him, when she had been able to detect anything approaching
      sentiment in his tone&mdash;and those few times had been when he had
      spoken of another woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff looked out into the blackness, through the glittering arc of
      lights, and perhaps for once he suffered his fancy to build for him
      visions of things that were not of earth. If so, however, it was a moment
      which swiftly passed. His reply was in a tone as matter of fact as his
      usual speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do not exactly see the end of my present expedition&mdash;I
      do not understand its object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some apprehension?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Why should I? There is an unwritten bargain,&rdquo;
       he added, a little more slowly, &ldquo;to which I subscribed with our friends
      here, and I have certainly kept it. In fact, the balance is on my side.
      There is nothing for me to fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The train crept into the Gare du Nord, and they passed through the usual
      routine of the Customs House. Then, in an omnibus, they rumbled slowly
      over the cobblestones, through the region of barely lit streets and untidy
      cafes, down the Rue Lafayette, across the famous Square and into the Rue
      de Rivoli.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our movements,&rdquo; Peter Ruff remarked dryly, &ldquo;are too well known for us to
      attempt to conceal them. We may as well stop at one of the large hotels.
      It will be more cheerful for you while I am away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They engaged rooms at the Continental. Miss Brown, whose apartments were
      in the wing of the hotel overlooking the gardens, ascended at once to her
      room. Peter Ruff, who had chosen a small suite on the other side, went
      into the bar for a whiskey and soda. A man touched him on the elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Monsieur,&rdquo; he murmured, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff turned and opened the note. It bore a faint perfume, it had a
      coronet upon the flap of the envelope, and it was written in a delicate
      feminine handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR Mr. RUFF:
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are not too tired with your journey, will you call soon after one
      o&rsquo;clock to meet some old friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANCHE DE MAUPASSIM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff drank his whiskey and soda, went up to his rooms, and made a
      careful toilet. Then he sent a page up for Violet, who came down within a
      few minutes. She was dressed with apparent simplicity in a high-necked
      gown, a large hat, and a single rope of pearls. In place of the usual gold
      purse, she carried a small white satin bag, exquisitely hand-painted.
      Everything about her bespoke that elegant restraint so much a feature of
      the Parisian woman of fashion herself. Peter Ruff, who had told her to
      prepare for supping out, was at first struck by the simplicity of her
      attire. Afterwards, he came to appreciate its perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to the Cafe de Paris, where they were the first arrivals.
      People, however, began to stream in before they had finished their meal,
      and Peter Ruff, comparing his companion&rsquo;s appearance with the more
      flamboyant charms of these ladies from the Opera and the theatres, began
      to understand the numerous glances of admiration which the impressionable
      Frenchmen so often turned in their direction. There was between them,
      toward the end of the meal, something which amounted almost to
      nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to keep your appointment to-night, Peter?&rdquo; his companion
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I have taken you home,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall probably return
      late, so we will breakfast here to-morrow morning, if you like, at
      half-past twelve. I will send a note to your room when I am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked him in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;supposing that note doesn&rsquo;t come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you and I&mdash;or rather I, for you are not
      concerned in this&mdash;live a life which is a little different from the
      lives of most of the people around us. The million pay their taxes, and
      they expect police protection in times of danger. For me there is no such
      resource. My life has its own splendid compensations. I have weapons with
      which to fight any ordinary danger. What I want to explain to you is this&mdash;that
      if you hear no more of me, you can do nothing. If that note does not come
      to you in the morning, you can do nothing. Wait here for three days, and
      after that go back to England. You will find a letter on your desk,
      telling you there exactly what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have something in your mind,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;of which you have not told
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing,&rdquo; he answered, firmly. &ldquo;Upon my honor, I know of no
      possible cause of offense which our friends could have against me. Their
      summons is, I will admit, somewhat extraordinary, but I go to obey it
      absolutely without fear. You can sleep well, Violet. We lunch here
      to-morrow, without a doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drove back to the hotel almost in silence. Violet was looking fixedly
      out of the window of the taxicab, as though interested in watching the
      crowds upon the street. Peter Ruff appeared to be absorbed in his own
      thoughts. Yet perhaps they were both of them nearer to one another than
      either surmised. Their parting in the hall of the Continental Hotel was
      unemotional enough. For a moment Peter Ruff had hesitated while her hand
      had lain in his. He had opened his lips as though he had something to say.
      Her eyes grew suddenly softer&mdash;seemed to seek his as though begging
      for those unspoken words. But Peter Ruff did not say them then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be back all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good night, Violet! Sleep well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned back towards the waiting taxicab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number 16, Rue de St. Quintaine,&rdquo; he told the man. It was not a long
      ride. In less than a quarter of an hour, Peter Ruff presented himself
      before a handsome white house in a quiet, aristocratic-looking street. At
      his summons, the postern door flew open, and a man-servant in plain livery
      stood at the second entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame la Marquise?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man bowed in silence, and took the visitor&rsquo;s hat and overcoat. He
      passed along a spacious hall and into a delightfully furnished reception
      room, where an old lady with gray hair sat in the midst of a little circle
      of men. Peter Ruff stood, for a moment, upon the threshold, looking around
      him. She held out her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Monsieur Peter Ruff, is it not? At last, then, I am gratified. I
      have wished for so long to see one who has become so famous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff took her hands in his and raised them gallantly to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is a pleasure indeed. At my last visit here, you
      were in Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grow old,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I leave Paris but little now. Where one has
      lived, one should at least be content to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame speaks a philosophy,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered, &ldquo;which as yet she has
      no need to learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady turned to a man who stood upon her right:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this from an Englishman!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were others who took Peter Ruff by the hand then. The servants were
      handing round coffee in little Sevres cups. On the sideboard was a choice
      of liqueurs and bottles of wine. Peter Ruff found himself hospitably
      entertained with both small talk and refreshments. But every now and then
      his eyes wandered back to where Madame sat in her chair, her hair as white
      as snow&mdash;beautiful still, in spite of the cruel mouth and the narrow
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is wonderful!&rdquo; he murmured to a man who stood by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is eighty-six,&rdquo; was the answer in a whisper, &ldquo;and she knows
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the clock struck two, a tall footman entered the room and wheeled
      Madame&rsquo;s chair away. Several of the guests left at the same time. Ruff,
      when the door was closed, counted those who remained. As he had imagined
      would be the case, he found that there were eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall, gray-bearded man, who from the first had attached himself to Ruff,
      and who seemed to act as a sort of master of ceremonies, now approached
      him once more and laid his hand upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon ami,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will now discuss, if it pleases you, the little
      matter concerning which we took the liberty of asking you to favor us with
      a visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, here?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked, in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend, who had introduced himself as Monsieur de Founcelles, smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Ah, but I think I understand!&rdquo; he added, almost
      immediately. &ldquo;You are English, Monsieur Peter Ruff, and in some respects
      you have not moved with the times. Confess, now, that your idea of a
      secret society is a collection of strangely attired men who meet in a
      cellar, and build subterranean passages in case of surprise. In Paris, I
      think, we have gone beyond that sort of thing. We of the &lsquo;Double-Four&rsquo; 
      have no headquarters save the drawing-room of Madame; no hiding-places
      whatsoever; no meeting-places save the fashionable cafes or our own
      reception rooms. The police follow us&mdash;what can they discover?&mdash;nothing!
      What is there to discover?&mdash;nothing! Our lives are lived before the
      eyes of all Paris. There is never any suspicion of mystery about any of
      our movements. We have our hobbies, and we indulge in them. Monsieur the
      Marquis de Sogrange here is a great sportsman. Monsieur le Comte owns many
      racehorses. I myself am an authority on pictures, and own a collection
      which I have bequeathed to the State. Paris knows us well as men of
      fashion and mark&mdash;Paris does not guess that we have perfected an
      organization so wonderful that the whole criminal world pays toll to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;this is very interesting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a trained army at our disposal,&rdquo; Monsieur de Founcelles
      continued, &ldquo;who numerically, as well as in intelligence, outnumber the
      whole force of gendarmes in Paris. No criminal from any other country can
      settle down here and hope for success, unless he joins us. An exploit
      which is inspired by us cannot fail. Our agents may count on our
      protection, and receive it without question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am bewildered,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, frankly. &ldquo;I do not understand how you
      gentlemen&mdash;whom one knows by name so well as patrons of sport and
      society, can spare the time for affairs of such importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Founcelles nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have very valuable aid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is below us&mdash;the
      &lsquo;Double-Four&rsquo;&mdash;the eight gentlemen now present, an executive council
      composed of five of the shrewdest men in France. They take their orders
      from us. We plan, and they obey. We have imagination, and special sources
      of knowledge. They have the most perfect machinery for carrying out our
      schemes that it is possible to imagine. I do not wish to boast, Mr. Ruff,
      but if I take a directory of Paris and place after any man&rsquo;s name,
      whatever his standing or estate, a black cross, that man dies before seven
      days have passed. You buy your evening paper&mdash;a man has committed
      suicide! You read of a letter found by his side: an unfortunate love
      affair&mdash;a tale of jealousy or reckless speculation. Mr. Ruff, the
      majority of these explanations are false. They are invented and arranged
      for by us. This year alone, five men in Paris, of position, have been
      found dead, and accounted, for excellent reasons, suicides. In each one of
      these cases, Monsieur Ruff, although not a soul has a suspicion of it, the
      removal of these men was arranged for by the&rsquo; Double-Four.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;that it may never be my ill-fortune to incur
      the displeasure of so marvelous an association.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, Monsieur Ruff,&rdquo; the other answered, &ldquo;the attention of
      the association has been directed towards certain incidents of your career
      in a most favorable manner. We have spoken of you often lately, Mr. Ruff,
      between ourselves. We arrive now at the object for which we begged the
      honor of your visit. It is to offer you the Presidency of our Executive
      Council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff had thought of many things, but he had not thought of this! He
      gasped, recovered himself, and realized at once the dangers of the
      position in which he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Council of Five!&rdquo; he said thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; Monsieur de Founcelles replied. &ldquo;The salary&mdash;forgive me
      for giving such prominence to a matter which you doubtless consider of
      secondary importance&mdash;is ten thousand pounds a year, with a residence
      here and in London&mdash;also servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is princely!&rdquo; Peter Ruff declared. &ldquo;I cannot imagine, Monsieur, how
      you could have believed me capable of filling such a position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not much about you, Mr. Ruff, which we do not know,&rdquo; Monsieur de
      Founcelles answered. &ldquo;There are points about your career which we have
      marked with admiration. Your work over here was rapid and comprehensive.
      We know all about your checkmating the Count von Hern and the Comtesse de
      Pilitz. We have appealed to you for aid once only&mdash;your response was
      prompt and brilliant. You have all the qualifications we desire. You are
      still young, physically you are sound, you speak all languages, and you
      are unmarried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am what?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked, with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bachelor,&rdquo; Monsieur de Founcelles answered. &ldquo;We who have made crime and
      its detection a life-long study, have reduced many matters concerning it
      to almost mathematical exactitude. Of one thing we have become absolutely
      convinced&mdash;it is that the great majority of cases in which the police
      triumph are due to the treachery of women. The criminal who steers clear
      of the other sex escapes a greater danger than the detectives who dog his
      heels. It is for that reason that we choose only unmarried men for our
      executive council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff made a gesture of despair. &ldquo;And I am to be married in a month!&rdquo;
       he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur of dismay. If those other seven men had not once
      intervened, it was because the conduct of the affair had been voted into
      the hands of Monsieur de Founcelles, and there was little which he had
      left unsaid. Nevertheless, they had formed a little circle around the two
      men. Every word passing between them had been listened to eagerly.
      Gestures and murmured exclamations had been frequent enough. There arose
      now a chorus of voices which their leader had some difficulty in
      silencing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be arranged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is impossible&mdash;this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Ruff amuses himself with us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;I can assure you that I do nothing of the
      sort. The affair was arranged some months ago, and the young lady is even
      now in Paris, purchasing her trousseau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Founcelles, with a wave of the hand, commanded silence. There
      was probably a way out. In any case, one must be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Ruff,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;putting aside, for one moment, your sense of
      honor, which of course forbids you even to consider the possibility of
      breaking your word&mdash;supposing that the young lady herself should
      withdraw&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Miss Brown!&rdquo; Peter Ruff interrupted. &ldquo;It is a pleasure to
      which I hope to attain,&rdquo; Monsieur de Founcelles declared, smoothly. &ldquo;Let
      us consider once more my proposition. I take it for granted that, apart
      from this threatened complication, you find it agreeable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am deeply honored by it,&rdquo; Peter Ruff declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that being so,&rdquo; Monsieur de Founcelles said, more cheerfully, &ldquo;we
      must see whether we cannot help you. Tell me, who is this fortunate young
      lady&mdash;this Miss Brown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a young person of good birth and some means,&rdquo; Peter Ruff declared.
      &ldquo;She is, in a small way, an actress; she has also been my secretary from
      the first.&rdquo; Monsieur de Founcelles nodded his head thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She knows your secrets, then, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does,&rdquo; Peter Ruff assented. &ldquo;She knows a great deal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young person to be conciliated by all means,&rdquo; Monsieur de Founcelles
      declared. &ldquo;Well, we must see. When, Monsieur Ruff, may I have the
      opportunity of making the acquaintance of this young lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning, or rather this morning, if you will,&rdquo; Peter Ruff
      answered. &ldquo;We are taking breakfast together at the cafe de Paris. It will
      give me great pleasure if you will join us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; Monsieur de Founcelles declared, &ldquo;I must beg of you
      slightly to alter your plans. I will ask you and Mademoiselle to do me the
      honor of breakfasting at the Ritz with the Marquis de Sogrange and myself,
      at the same hour. We shall find there more opportunity for a short
      discussion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am entirely at your service,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. There were signs now
      of a breaking-up of the little party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must all regret, dear Monsieur Ruff,&rdquo; Monsieur de Founcelles said, as
      he made his adieux, &ldquo;this temporary obstruction to the consummation of our
      hopes. Let us pray that Mademoiselle will not be unreasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; Peter Ruff murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff drove through the gray dawn to his hotel, in the splendid
      automobile of Monsieur de Founcelles, whose homeward route lay in that
      direction. It was four o&rsquo;clock when he accepted his key from a
      sleepy-looking clerk, and turned towards the staircase. The hotel was
      wrapped in semi-gloom. Sweepers and cleaners were at work. The palms had
      been turned out into the courtyard. Dust sheets lay over the furniture.
      One person only, save himself and the untidy-looking servants, was astir.
      From a distant corner which commanded the entrance, he saw Violet stealing
      away to the corridor which led to her part of the hotel. She had sat there
      all through the night to see him come in&mdash;to be assured of his
      safety! Peter Ruff stared after her disappearing figure as one might have
      watched a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The luncheon-party was a great success. Peter Ruff was human enough to be
      proud of his companion&mdash;proud of her smartness, which was indubitable
      even here, surrounded as they were by Frenchwomen of the best class; proud
      of her accent, of the admiration which she obviously excited in the two
      Frenchmen. His earlier enjoyment of the meal was a little clouded from the
      fact that he felt himself utterly outshone in the matter of general
      appearance. No tailor had ever suggested to him a coat so daring and yet
      so perfect as that which adorned the person of the Marquis de Sogrange.
      The deep violet of his tie was a shade unknown in Bond Street&mdash;inimitable&mdash;a
      true education in color. They had the bearing, too, these Frenchmen! He
      watched Monsieur de Founcelles bending over Violet, and he was suddenly
      conscious of a wholly new sensation. He did not recognize&mdash;could not
      even classify it. He only knew that it was not altogether pleasant, and
      that it set the warm blood tingling through his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until they were sitting out in the winter garden, taking their
      coffee and liqueurs, that the object of their meeting was referred to.
      Then Monsieur de Founcelles drew Violet a little away from the others, and
      the Marquis, with a meaning smile, took Peter Ruff&rsquo;s arm and led him on
      one side. Monsieur de Founcelles wasted no words at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Monsieur Ruff has doubtless told you that last
      night I made him the offer of a great position among us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with twinkling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, please,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offered him a position of great dignity&mdash;of great responsibility,&rdquo;
       Monsieur de Founcelles continued. &ldquo;I cannot explain to you its exact
      nature, but it is in connection with the most wonderful organization of
      its sort which the world has ever known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Double-Four,&rsquo;&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attached to the post is a princely salary and but one condition,&rdquo;
       Monsieur de Founcelles said, watching the girl&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;The condition is
      that Mr. Ruff remains a bachelor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Violet nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s told me all this,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;He wants me to give him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Founcelles drew a little closer to his companion. There was a
      peculiar smile upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;forgive me if I point out to you
      that with your appearance and gifts a marriage with our excellent friend
      is surely not the summit of your ambitions! Here in Paris, I promise you,
      here&mdash;we can do much better than that for you. You have not, perhaps,
      a dot? Good! That is our affair. Give up our friend here, and we deposit
      in any bank you like to name the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand
      francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred and fifty thousand francs!&rdquo; Violet repeated, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Founcelles nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not enough,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Founcelles raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not bargain,&rdquo; he said coldly, &ldquo;and money is not the chief thing in
      the world. It is for you, then, to name a sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Founcelles,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;can you tell me the amount of the
      national debt of France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere about nine hundred million francs, I believe,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly my price,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For giving up Peter Ruff?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at her employer thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look worth it, does he?&rdquo; she said, with a queer little smile.
      &ldquo;I happen to care for him, though&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Founcelles shrugged his shoulders. He knew men and women, and
      for the present he accepted defeat. He sighed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate our friend, and I envy him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If ever you should
      change your mind, Mademoiselle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is our privilege, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she remarked, with a brilliant smile. &ldquo;If
      I do, I shall certainly let you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the way home, Peter Ruff was genial&mdash;Miss Brown silent. He had
      escaped from a difficult position, and his sense of gratitude toward his
      companion was strong. He showed her many little attentions on the voyage
      which sometimes escaped him. From Dover, they had a carriage to
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; Miss Brown said, after he had made her comfortable, &ldquo;when is it
      to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is what to be?&rdquo; he asked, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our marriage,&rdquo; she answered, looking at him for a moment in most
      bewildering fashion and then suddenly dropping her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff returned her gaze in blank amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Violet?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; she answered, composedly. &ldquo;When are we going to be
      married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are not going to be married. You know that
      quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she declared, smiling at him in a heavenly fashion. &ldquo;At
      your request I have told Monsieur de Founcelles that we were engaged.
      Incidentally, I have refused two hundred and fifty thousand francs and, I
      believe, an admirer, for your sake. I declared that I was going to marry
      you, and I must keep my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff began to feel giddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know very well that we arranged all
      that between ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arranged all that?&rdquo; she repeated, with a little laugh. &ldquo;Perhaps we did.
      You asked me to marry you, and you posed as my fiancee. You kept it up
      just as long as you&mdash;it suits me to keep it up a little longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say&mdash;do you seriously mean that you expect me to
      marry you?&rdquo; he asked, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I have meant you to for some time, Peter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was very alluring, and Peter Ruff hesitated. She held out her hands
      and leaned towards him. Her muff fell to the floor. She had raised her
      veil, and a faint perfume of violets stole into the carriage. Her lips
      were a little parted, her eyes were saying unutterable things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me to sue you, do you, Peter?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff sighed&mdash;and yielded.

      CHAPTER X. WONDERFUL JOHN DORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The woman who had been Peter Ruff&rsquo;s first love had fallen upon evil days.
      Her prettiness was on the wane&mdash;powder and rouge, late hours, and
      excesses of many kinds, had played havoc with it, even in these few
      months. Her clothes were showy but cheap. Her boots themselves, unclean
      and down at heel, told the story. She stood upon the threshold of Peter
      Ruff&rsquo;s office, and looked half defiantly, half doubtfully at Violet, who
      was its sole occupant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I do anything for you?&rdquo; the latter asked, noticing the woman&rsquo;s
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see Mr. Ruff,&rdquo; the visitor said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ruff is out at present,&rdquo; Violet answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will he be in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you,&rdquo; Violet said. &ldquo;Perhaps you had better leave a message.
      Or will you call again? Mr. Ruff is very uncertain in his movements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maud sank into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; Violet remarked, raising her eyebrows, &ldquo;whether that will
      be convenient. There may be other clients in. Mr. Ruff himself may not be
      back for several hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you his secretary?&rdquo; Maud asked, without moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am his secretary and also his wife,&rdquo; Violet declared. The woman raised
      herself a little in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people have all the luck,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a few months ago
      that Mr. Ruff was glad enough to take me out. You remember when I used to
      come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; Violet assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was all right then,&rdquo; the woman continued, &ldquo;and now&mdash;now I&rsquo;m down
      and out,&rdquo; she added, with a little sob. &ldquo;You see what I am like. You look
      as though you didn&rsquo;t care to have me in the office, and I don&rsquo;t wonder at
      it. You look as though you were afraid I&rsquo;d come to beg, and you are right&mdash;I
      have come to beg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure Mr. Ruff will do what he can for you,&rdquo; Violet said, &ldquo;although&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you know all about it,&rdquo; Maud interrupted, with a hard little laugh.
      &ldquo;I came once to wheedle information out of him. I came to try and betray
      the only man who ever really cared for me. Mr. Ruff was too clever, and I
      am thankful for it. I have been as big a fool as a woman can be, but I am
      paying&mdash;oh, I am paying for it right enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swayed in her chair, and Violet was only just in time to catch her.
      She led the fainting woman to an inner room, made her comfortable upon a
      sofa, and sent out for some food and a bottle of wine. Down in the street
      below, John Dory, who had tracked his wife to the building, was walking
      away with face as black as night. He knew that Maud had lost her position,
      that she was in need of money&mdash;almost penniless. He had waited to see
      to whom she would turn, hoping&mdash;poor fool as he called himself&mdash;that
      she would come back to him. And it was his enemy to whom she had gone! He
      had seen her enter the building; he knew that she had not left it. In the
      morning they brought him another report&mdash;she was still within. It was
      the end, this, he told himself! There must be a settlement between him and
      Peter Ruff!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. John Dory, who had arrived at Clenarvon Court in a four-wheel cab from
      the nearest railway station, was ushered by the butler to the door of one
      of the rooms on the ground floor, overlooking the Park. A policeman was
      there on guard&mdash;a policeman by his attitude and salute, although he
      was in plain clothes. John Dory nodded, and turned to the butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, the man knows me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here is my card. I am John Dory
      from Scotland Yard. I want to have a few words with the sergeant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our orders are very strict, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am afraid that I cannot
      allow you to enter the room without a special permit from his lordship.
      You see, we have had no advice of your coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If every one were to obey his orders as
      literally, there would be fewer robberies. However, you see that this man
      recognizes me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler turned toward an elderly gentleman in a pink coat and
      riding-breeches, who had just descended into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship is here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He will give you permission, without a
      doubt. There is a gentleman from Scotland Yard, your lordship,&rdquo; he
      explained, &ldquo;who wishes to enter the morning-room to speak with the
      sergeant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inspector John Dory, at your lordship&rsquo;s service,&rdquo; saluting. &ldquo;I have been
      sent down from town to help in this little business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Clenarvon smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought that, under the circumstances,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;two of
      you would have been enough. Still, it is not for me to complain. Pray go
      in and speak to the sergeant. You will find him inside. Rather dull work
      for him, I&rsquo;m afraid, and quite unnecessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure, your lordship,&rdquo; Dory answered. &ldquo;The Clenarvon diamonds
      are known all over the world, and I suppose there isn&rsquo;t a thieves&rsquo; den in
      Europe that does not know that they will remain here exposed with your
      daughter&rsquo;s other wedding presents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Clenarvon smiled once more and shrugged his shoulders. He was a man
      who had unbounded faith in his fellow-creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is the penalty one has to pay for historical
      possessions. Go in and talk to the sergeant, by all means, Mr. Dory. I
      hope that Graves will succeed in making you comfortable during your stay
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory was accordingly admitted into the room which was so jealously
      guarded. At first sight, it possessed a somewhat singular appearance. The
      windows had every one of them been boarded up, and the electric lights
      consequently fully turned on. A long table stood in the middle of the
      apartment, serving as support for a long glass showcase, open at the top.
      Within this, from end to end, stretched the presents which a large circle
      of acquaintances were presenting to one of the most popular young women in
      society, on the occasion of her approaching marriage to the Duke of
      Rochester. In the middle, the wonderful Clenarvon diamonds, set in the
      form of a tiara, flashed strange lights into the somberly lit apartment.
      At the end of the table a police sergeant was sitting, with a little pile
      of newspapers and illustrated journals before him. He rose to his feet
      with alacrity at his superior&rsquo;s entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Saunders,&rdquo; John Dory said. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve got it pretty snug
      in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well, thank you, sir,&rdquo; Saunders answered. &ldquo;Is there anything
      stirring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory looked behind to be sure that the door was closed. Then he
      stopped for a moment to gaze at the wonderful diamonds, and finally sat on
      the table by his subordinate&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly that, Saunders,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I came down
      here because of that list of guests you sent me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saunders smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can guess the name you singled out, sir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Peter Ruff, of course,&rdquo; Dory said. &ldquo;What is he doing here in the
      house, under his own name, and as a guest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked no questions, sir,&rdquo; Saunders answered. &ldquo;I underlined the
      name in case it might seem worth your while to make inquiries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing has happened, of course?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Saunders answered. &ldquo;You see, with the windows all boarded up,
      there is practically only the ordinary door to guard, so we feel fairly
      secure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one hanging about?&rdquo; the detective asked. &ldquo;Mr. Ruff himself, for
      instance, hasn&rsquo;t been trying to make your acquaintance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sign of it, sir,&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;I saw him pass through the hall
      yesterday afternoon, as I went off duty, and he was in riding clothes all
      splashed with mud. I think he has been hunting every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory muttered something between his lips, and turned on his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many men have you here, Saunders?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only two, sir, beside myself,&rdquo; the man replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective went round the boarded windows, examining the work carefully
      until he reached the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to see if I can have a word with his lordship,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught Lord Clenarvon in the act of mounting his horse in the great
      courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mr. Dory?&rdquo; the Earl asked, stooping down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one name, your lordship, among your list of guests, concerning
      which I wish to have a word with you,&rdquo; the detective said&mdash;&ldquo;the name
      of Mr. Peter Ruff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know anything about him,&rdquo; Lord Clenarvon answered, cheerfully. &ldquo;You
      must see my daughter, Lady Mary. It was she who sent him his invitation.
      Seems a decent little fellow, and rides as well as the best. You&rsquo;ll find
      Lady Mary about somewhere, if you&rsquo;d like to ask her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Clenarvon hurried off, with a little farewell wave of his crop, and
      John Dory returned into the house to make inquiries respecting Lady Mary.
      In a very few minutes he was shown into her presence. She smiled at him
      cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another detective!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I am sure I ought to feel quite safe
      now. What can I do for you, Mr. Dory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had a list of the guests sent to me,&rdquo; Dory answered, &ldquo;in which I
      notice the name of Mr. Peter Ruff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just spoken to his lordship,&rdquo; the detective continued, &ldquo;and he
      referred me to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to know all about Mr. Ruff?&rdquo; Lady Mary asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your ladyship will pardon my saying so, I think that neither you nor
      any one else could tell me that. What I wished to say was that I
      understood that we at Scotland Yard were placed in charge of your jewels
      until after the wedding. Mr. Peter Ruff is, as you may be aware, a private
      detective himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand perfectly,&rdquo; Lady Mary said. &ldquo;I can assure you, Mr. Dory,
      that Mr. Ruff is here entirely as a personal and very valued friend of my
      own. On two occasions he has rendered very signal service to my family&mdash;services
      which I am quite unable to requite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, your ladyship, there is nothing more to be said. I conceive
      it, however, to be my duty to tell you that in our opinion&mdash;the
      opinion of Scotland Yard&mdash;there are things about the career of Mr.
      Peter Ruff which need explanation. He is a person whom we seldom let
      altogether out of our sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mary laughed frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Dory,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is one of the cases, then, in which I
      can assure you that I know more than Scotland Yard. There is no person in
      the world in whom I have more confidence, and with more reason, than Mr.
      Peter Ruff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank your ladyship,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I trust that your confidence will never
      be misplaced. May I ask one more question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Lady Mary replied, &ldquo;so long as you make no insinuations
      whatever against my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very sorry to do so,&rdquo; John Dory declared. &ldquo;I simply wish to
      know whether Mr. Ruff has any instructions from you with reference to the
      care of your jewels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Lady Mary replied, decidedly. &ldquo;Mr. Ruff is here entirely
      as my guest. He has been in the room with the rest of us, to look at them,
      and it was he, by the bye, who discovered a much more satisfactory way of
      boarding the windows. Anything else, Mr. Dory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank your ladyship, nothing!&rdquo; the detective answered. &ldquo;With your
      permission, I propose to remain here until after the ceremony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you like, of course,&rdquo; Lady Mary said. &ldquo;I hope you will be
      comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory bowed, and returned to confer with his sergeant. Afterwards,
      finding the morning still fine, he took his hat and went for a walk in the
      park.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, this, in some respects the most remarkable of the
      adventures which had ever befallen Mr. Peter Ruff, came to him by
      accident. Lady Mary had read the announcement of his marriage in the
      paper, had driven at once to his office with a magnificent present, and
      insisted upon his coming with his wife to the party which was assembling
      at Clenarvon Court in honor of her own approaching wedding. Peter Ruff had
      taken few holidays of late years, and for several days had thoroughly
      enjoyed himself. The matter of the Clenarvon jewels he considered,
      perhaps, with a slight professional interest; but so far as he could see,
      the precautions for guarding them were so adequate that the subject did
      not remain in his memory. He had, however, a very distinct and
      disagreeable shock when, on the night of John Dory&rsquo;s appearance, he
      recognized among a few newly-arrived guests the Marquis de Sogrange. He
      took the opportunity, as soon as possible, of withdrawing his wife from a
      little circle among whom they had been talking, to a more retired corner
      of the room. She saw at once that something had happened to disturb him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look behind now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recognized him at once,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;It is the Marquis de
      Sogrange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be best for you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not to notice him. Of course, his
      presence here may be accidental. He has a perfect right to enter any
      society he chooses. At the same time, I am uneasy.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Clenarvon diamonds!&rdquo; she whispered. He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just the sort of affair which would appeal to the &lsquo;Double-Four,&rsquo;&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;They are worth anything up to a quarter of a million, and it is
      an enterprise which could scarcely be attempted except by some one in a
      peculiar position. Violet, if I were not sure that he had seen me, I
      should leave the house this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand,&rdquo; Peter Ruff continued, softly, &ldquo;that I myself am
      still what they call a corresponding member of the &lsquo;Double-Four,&rsquo; and they
      have a right to appeal to me for help in this country, as I have a right
      to appeal to them for help or information in France? We have both made use
      of one another, to some extent. No doubt, if the Marquis has any scheme in
      his mind, he would look upon me as a valuable ally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned slowly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t dream&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t dare to be so
      foolish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we talked that all out long ago. A few years
      since, I felt that I had been treated badly, that I was an alien, and that
      the hand of the law was against me. I talked wildly then, perhaps. When I
      put up my sign and sat down for clients, I meant to cheat the law, if I
      could. Things have changed, Violet. I want nothing of that sort. I have
      kept my hands clean and I mean to do so. Why, years ago,&rdquo; he continued,
      &ldquo;when I was feeling at my wildest, these very jewels were within my grasp
      one foggy night, and I never touched them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would happen if you refused to help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;The conditions are a little severe.
      But, after all, there are no hard and fast rules. It rests with the
      Marquis himself to shrug his shoulders and appreciate my position. Perhaps
      he may not even exchange a word with me. Here is Lord Sotherst coming to
      talk to you, and Captain Hamilton is waiting for me to tell him an
      address. Remember, don&rsquo;t recognize Sogrange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinner that night was an unusually cheerful meal. Peter Ruff, who was an
      excellent raconteur, told many stories. The Marquis de Sogrange was
      perhaps the next successful in his efforts to entertain his neighbors.
      Violet found him upon her left hand, and although he showed not the
      slightest signs of having ever seen her before, they were very soon
      excellent friends. After dinner, Sogrange and Peter Ruff drifted together
      on their way to the billiard-room. Sogrange, however, continued to talk
      courteously of trifles until, having decided to watch the first game, they
      found themselves alone on the leather divan surrounding the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an unexpected pleasure, my friend,&rdquo; Sogrange said, watching the
      ash of his cigar. &ldquo;Professional?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head. &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have had
      the good fortune to render Lady Mary and her brother, at different times,
      services which they are pleased to value highly. We are here as ordinary
      guests&mdash;my wife and I.&rdquo; The Marquis sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that wife of yours, Ruff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She is charming, I admit, and
      you are a lucky man; but it was a price&mdash;a very great price to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, perhaps, are ambitious, Marquis,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;I have not
      done so badly. A little contents me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange looked at him as though he were some strange creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I see! With you, of course, the commercial side
      comes uppermost. Mr. Ruff, what do you suppose the income from my estate
      amounts to?&rdquo; Peter Ruff shook his head. He did not even know that the
      Marquis was possessed of estates!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere about seven millions of francs,&rdquo; Sogrange declared. &ldquo;There are
      few men in Paris more extravagant than I, and I think that we Frenchmen
      know what extravagance means. But I cannot spend my income. Do you think
      that it is for the sake of gain that I have come across the Channel to add
      the Clenarvon diamonds to our coffers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff sat very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Sogrange answered. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you realize it directly you saw
      me? What is there, do you think, in a dull English house-party to attract
      a man like myself? Don&rsquo;t you understand that it is the gambler&rsquo;s instinct&mdash;the
      restless desire to be playing pitch-and-toss with fate, with honor, with
      life and death, if you will&mdash;that brings such as myself into the
      ranks of the &lsquo;Double-Four&rsquo;? It is the weariness which kills, Peter Ruff.
      One must needs keep it from one&rsquo;s bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marquis,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered, &ldquo;I do not profess to understand you. I am
      not weary of life, in fact I love it. I am looking forward to the years
      when I have enough money&mdash;and it seems as though that time is not far
      off&mdash;when I can buy a little place in the country, and hunt a little
      and shoot a little, and live a simple out-of-door life. You see, Marquis,
      we are as far removed as the poles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obviously!&rdquo; Sogrange answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your confidence,&rdquo; Peter Ruff continued, &ldquo;the confidence with which you
      have honored me, inspires me to make you one request. I am here, indeed,
      as a friend of the family. You will not ask me to help in any designs you
      may have against the Clenarvon jewels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange leaned back in his chair and laughed softly. His lips, when they
      parted from his white teeth, resolved themselves into lines which at that
      moment seemed to Peter Ruff more menacing than mirthful. Sogrange was, in
      many ways, a man of remarkable appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Peter Ruff,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are a bourgeois little person! You should
      have been the burgomaster in a little German town, or a French mayor with
      a chain about your neck. We will see. I make no promises. All that I
      insist upon, for the present, is that you do not leave this house-party
      without advising me&mdash;that is to say, if you are really looking
      forward to that pleasant life in the country, where you will hunt a little
      and shoot a little, and grow into the likeness of a vegetable. You, with
      your charming wife! Peter Ruff, you should be ashamed to talk like that!
      Come, I must play bridge with the Countess. I am engaged for a table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men parted. Peter Ruff was uneasy. On his way from the room, Lord
      Sotherst insisted upon his joining a pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming fellow, Sogrange,&rdquo; the latter remarked, as he chalked his cue.
      &ldquo;He has been a great friend of the governor&rsquo;s&mdash;he and his father
      before him. Our families have intermarried once or twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems very agreeable,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered, devoting himself to the
      game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following night, being the last but one before the wedding itself, a
      large dinner-party had been arranged for, and the resources of even so
      princely a mansion as Clenarvon Court were strained to their utmost by the
      entertainment of something like one hundred guests in the great
      banqueting-hall. The meal was about half-way through when those who were
      not too entirely engrossed in conversation were startled by hearing a
      dull, rumbling sound, like the moving of a number of pieces of heavy
      furniture. People looked doubtfully at one another. Peter Ruff and the
      Marquis de Sogrange were among the first to spring to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an explosion somewhere,&rdquo; the latter cried. &ldquo;Sounds close at hand,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They made their way out into the hall. Exactly opposite now was the room
      in which the wedding presents had been placed, and where for days nothing
      had been seen but a closed door and a man on duty outside. The door now
      stood wide open, and in place of the single electric light which was left
      burning through the evening, the place seemed almost aflame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruff, Sogrange and Lord Sotherst were the first three to cross the
      threshold. They were met by a rush of cold wind. Opposite to them, two of
      the windows, with their boardings, had been blown away. Sergeant Saunders
      was still sitting in his usual place at the end of the table, his head
      bent upon his folded arms. The man who had been on duty outside was
      standing over him, white with horror. Far away in the distance, down the
      park, one could faintly hear the throbbing of an engine, and Peter Ruff,
      through the chasm, saw the lights of a great motor-car flashing in and out
      amongst the trees. The room itself&mdash;the whole glittering array of
      presents&mdash;seemed untouched. Only the great center-piece&mdash;the
      Clenarvon diamonds&mdash;had gone. Even as they stood there, the rest of
      the guests crowding into the open door, John Dory tore through, his face
      white with excitement. Peter Ruff&rsquo;s calm voice penetrated the din of
      tongues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Sotherst,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have telephones in the keepers&rsquo; lodges.
      There is a motor-car being driven southwards at full speed. Telephone
      down, and have your gates secured. Dory, I should keep every one out of
      the room. Some one must telephone for a doctor. I suppose your man has
      been hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests were wild with curiosity, but Lord Clenarvon, with an insistent
      gesture, led the way back to the diningroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever has happened,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the people who are in charge there know
      best how to deal with the situation. There is a detective from Scotland
      Yard and his subordinates, and a gentleman in whom I also have most
      implicit confidence. We will resume our dinner, if you please, ladies and
      gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unwillingly, the people were led away. John Dory was already in his
      great-coat, ready to spring into the powerful motor-car which had been
      ordered out from the garage. A doctor, who had been among the guests, was
      examining the man Saunders, who sat in that still, unnatural position at
      the head of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor fellow has been shot in the back of the head with some peculiar
      implement,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The bullet is very long&mdash;almost like a needle&mdash;and
      it seems to have penetrated very nearly to the base of the brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;An inch higher up and he must have died at once. I
      want some of the men-servants to help me carry him to a bedroom, and
      plenty of hot water. Some one else must go for my instrument case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Sotherst took these things in charge, and John Dory turned to the man
      whom they had found standing over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us exactly what happened,&rdquo; he said, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was standing outside the door,&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;I heard no sound
      inside&mdash;there was nothing to excite suspicion in any way. Suddenly
      there was this explosion. It took me, perhaps, thirty or forty seconds to
      get the key out of my pocket and unlock the door. When I entered, the side
      of the room was blown in like that, the diamonds were gone, Saunders was
      leaning forward just in the position he is in now, and there wasn&rsquo;t
      another soul in sight. Then you and the others came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory rushed from the room; they had brought him word that the car was
      waiting. At such a moment, he was ready even to forget his ancient enmity.
      He turned towards Peter Ruff, whose calm bearing somehow or other
      impressed even the detective with a sense of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come along?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Dory, no!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am glad you have asked me, but I think
      you had better go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few seconds later, the pursuit was started. Saunders was carried out of
      the room, followed by the doctor. There remained only Peter Ruff and the
      man who had been on duty outside. Peter Ruff seated himself where Saunders
      had been sitting, and seemed to be closely examining the table all round
      for some moments. Once he took up something from between the pages of the
      book which the Sergeant had apparently been reading, and put it carefully
      into his own pocketbook. Then he leaned back in the chair, with his hands
      clasped behind his head and his eyes fixed upon the ceiling, as though
      thinking intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hastings,&rdquo; he said to the policeman, who all the time was pursuing a
      stream of garrulous, inconsequent remarks, &ldquo;I wonder whether you&rsquo;d step
      outside and see Mr. Richards, the butler. Ask him if he would be so good
      as to spare me a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, sir,&rdquo; the man answered, with one more glance through the open
      space. &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;they must have been in through there and out
      again like cats!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was quick work, certainly,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered, genially, &ldquo;but then,
      an enterprise like this would, of course, only be attempted by experts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff was not left alone long. Mr. Richards came hurrying in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a terrible business, sir!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;His lordship has excused me
      from superintending the service of the dinner. Anything that I can do for
      you I am to give my whole attention to. These were my orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good of you, Richards,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered, &ldquo;very thoughtful of his
      lordship. In the first place, then, I think, we will have the rest of this
      jewelry packed in cases at once. Not that anything further is likely to
      happen,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but still, it would be just as well out of the
      way. I will remain here and superintend this, if you will send a couple of
      careful servants. In the meantime, I want you to do something else for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; the man answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a plan of the house,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;with the names of the
      guests who occupy this wing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler nodded gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can supply you with it very shortly, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is no
      difficulty at all about the plan, as I have several in my room; but it
      will take me some minutes to pencil in the names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will superintend things here until you return,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to be hoped, sir,&rdquo; the man said, as he retreated, &ldquo;that the
      gentleman from Scotland Yard will catch the thieves. After all, they
      hadn&rsquo;t more than ten minutes&rsquo; start, and our Daimler is a flyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered, heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, alas! no such fortune was in store for Mr. John Dory. At daybreak he
      returned in a borrowed trap from a neighboring railway station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our tires had been cut,&rdquo; he said, in reply to a storm of questions. &ldquo;They
      began to go, one after the other, as soon as we had any speed on. We
      traced the car to Salisbury, and there isn&rsquo;t a village within forty miles
      that isn&rsquo;t looking out for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff, who had just returned from an early morning walk, nodded
      sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you be here all day, Mr. Dory?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just a word or
      two I should like to have with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dory turned away. He had forced himself, in the excitement of the moment,
      to speak to his ancient enemy, but in this hour of his humility the man&rsquo;s
      presence was distasteful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; he said, shortly. &ldquo;It depends on how things may turn
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The daily life at Clenarvon Court proceeded exactly as usual. Breakfast
      was served early, as there was to be big day&rsquo;s shoot. The Marquis de
      Sogrange and Peter Ruff smoked their cigarettes together afterwards in the
      great hall. Then it was that Peter Ruff took the plunge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marquis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should like to know exactly how I stand with you&mdash;the
      &lsquo;Double-Four,&rsquo; that is to say&mdash;supposing I range myself for an hour
      or so on the side of the law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You amuse yourself, Mr. Ruff,&rdquo; he remarked genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;I am serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange watched the blue cigarette smoke come down his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am no amateur at this game. When I choose to
      play it, I am not afraid of Scotland Yard. I am not afraid,&rdquo; he concluded,
      with a little bow, &ldquo;even of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever bet, Marquis?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five thousand francs,&rdquo; Sogrange said, smiling, &ldquo;that your efforts
      to aid Mr. John Dory are unavailing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff entered the amount in his pocketbook. &ldquo;It is a bargain,&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;Our bet, I presume, carries immunity for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; Sogrange answered, with a little bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis beckoned to Lord Sotherst, who was crossing the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do tell me the name of your hatter in London.
      Delions failed me at the last moment, and I have not a hat fit for the
      ceremony to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend you half-a-dozen, if you can wear them,&rdquo; Lord Sotherst
      answered, smiling. &ldquo;The governor&rsquo;s sure to have plenty, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange touched his head with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My head is small, even for a Frenchman&rsquo;s. Imagine me&mdash;otherwise,
      I trust, suitably attired&mdash;walking to the church to-morrow in a hat
      which came to my ears!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Sotherst laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scotts will do you all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can telephone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall send my man up,&rdquo; Sogrange determined. &ldquo;He can bring me back a
      selection. Tell me, at what hour is the first drive this morning, and are
      the places drawn yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into the gun-room and we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Lord Sotherst answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff made his way to the back quarters of the house. In a little
      sitting-room he found the man he sought, sitting alone. Peter Ruff closed
      the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Dory,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have come to have a few words with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective rose to his feet. He was in no pleasant mood. Though the
      telephone wires had been flashing their news every few minutes, it seemed,
      indeed, as though the car which they had chased had vanished into space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to say to me?&rdquo; he asked gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want, if I can,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said earnestly, &ldquo;to do you a service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dory&rsquo;s eyes glittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I can do without your services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;You are harboring a grievance
      against me which is purely an imaginary one. Now listen to the facts. You
      employ your wife&mdash;which after all, Dory, I think, was not quite the
      straight thing&mdash;to try and track down a young man named Spencer
      Fitzgerald, who was formerly, in a small way, a client of mine. I find
      your wife an agreeable companion&mdash;we become friends. Then I discover
      her object, and know that I am being fooled. The end of that little
      episode you remember. But tell me why should you bear me ill-will for
      defending my friend and myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective came slowly up to Peter Ruff. He took hold of the lapel of
      the other&rsquo;s coat with his left hand, and his right hand was clenched. But
      Peter Ruff did not falter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; said Dory. &ldquo;I will tell you what grudge I bear against
      you. It was your entertainment of my wife which gave her the taste for
      luxury and for gadding about. Mind, I don&rsquo;t blame you for that altogether,
      but there the fact remains. She left me. She went on the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;You must still hold me blameless. She wrote to
      me. I went out with her once. The only advice I gave her was to return to
      you. So far as I am concerned, I have treated her with the respect that I
      would have shown my own sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; Dory cried, fiercely. &ldquo;A month ago, I saw her come to your
      fiat. I watched for hours. She did not leave it&mdash;she did not leave it
      all that night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you object to her visit,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said quietly, &ldquo;it is my wife whom
      you must blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory relaxed his hand and took a quick step backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife?&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;Maud&mdash;Mrs. Dory&mdash;called to see
      me; she was ill&mdash;she had lost her situation&mdash;she was even, I
      believe, faint and hungry. I was not present. My wife talked to her and
      was sorry for her. While the two women were there together, your wife
      fainted. She was put to bed in our one spare room, and she has been shown
      every attention and care. Tell me, how long is it since you were at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for ten days,&rdquo; Dory answered, bitterly. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because when you go back, you will find your wife there,&rdquo; Peter Ruff
      answered. &ldquo;She has given up the stage. Her one desire is to settle down
      and repay you for the trouble she has caused you. You needn&rsquo;t believe me
      unless you like. Ask my wife. She is here. She will tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dory was overcome. He went back to his seat by the window, and he buried
      his face for a moment in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruff,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve this. I&rsquo;ve had bad times lately, though.
      Everything has gone against me. I think I have been a bit careless, with
      the troubles at home and that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Peter Ruff insisted. &ldquo;Now I come to the immediate object of my
      visit to you. You have had some bad luck at headquarters. I know of it. I
      am going to help you to reinstate yourself brilliantly. With that, let us
      shake hands and bury all the soreness that there may be between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory stared at his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean this?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; answered Peter. &ldquo;Please do not think that I mean to make any
      reflection upon your skill. It is just a chance that I was able to see
      what you were not able to see. In an hour&rsquo;s time, you shall restore the
      Clenarvon diamonds to Lord Clenarvon. You shall take the reward which he
      has just offered, of a thousand pounds. And I promise you that the manner
      in which you shall recover the jewels shall be such that you will be
      famous for a long time to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a wonderful man!&rdquo; said Dory, hoarsely. &ldquo;Do you mean, then, that
      the jewels were not with those men in the motor-car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Peter Ruff answered. &ldquo;But come along. The story will
      develop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At half-past ten that morning, a motor-car turned out from the garage at
      Clenarvon Court, and made its way down the avenue. In it was a single
      passenger&mdash;the dark-faced Parisian valet of the Marquis de Sogrange.
      As the car left the avenue and struck into the main road, it was hailed by
      Peter Ruff and John Dory, who were walking together along the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, my man,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, addressing the chauffeur, &ldquo;are you going
      to the station?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;I am taking down the Marquis de Sogrange&rsquo;s
      servant to catch the eleven o&rsquo;clock train to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind giving us a lift?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked, already opening the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, sir,&rdquo; the man answered, touching his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff and John Dory stepped into the tonneau of the car. The man
      civilly lifted the hatbox from the seat, and made room for his enforced
      companions. Nevertheless, it was easy to see that he was not pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of room here for three,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, cheerfully, as
      they sat on either side of him. &ldquo;Drive slowly, please, chauffeur. Now, Mr.
      Lemprise,&rdquo; Peter Ruff added, &ldquo;we will trouble you to change places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; the man called out, suddenly pale as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was held as though in a vice. John Dory&rsquo;s arm was through his on one
      side, and Peter Ruff&rsquo;s on the other. Apart from that, the muzzle of a
      revolver was pressed to his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On second thoughts,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;I think we will keep you like
      this. Driver,&rdquo; he called out, &ldquo;please return to the Court at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You recognize the gentleman who is with me?&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;He is the
      detective from Scotland Yard. I have full authority from Lord Clenarvon
      over all his servants. Please do as I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated no more. The car was backed and turned, the Frenchman
      struggling all the way like a wild cat. Once he tried to kick the hatbox
      into the road, but John Dory was too quick for him. So they drove up to
      the front door of the Court, to be welcomed with cries of astonishment
      from the whole of the shooting party, who were just starting. Foremost
      among them was Sogrange. They crowded around the car. Peter Ruff touched
      the hatbox with his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we could trouble your Lordship,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to open that hatbox, you
      will find something that will interest you. Mr. Dory has planned a little
      surprise for you, in which I have been permitted to help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women, who gathered that something was happening, came hastening out
      from the hall. They all crowded round Lord Clenarvon, who was cutting
      through the leather strap of the hatbox. Inside the silk hat which reposed
      there, were the Clenarvon diamonds. Monsieur le Marquis de Sogrange was
      one of the foremost to give vent to an exclamation of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Marquis,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;this should be a lesson to you, I
      hope, to have the characters of your servants more rigidly verified. Mr.
      Dory tells me that this man came into your employ at the last moment with
      a forged recommendation. He is, in effect, a dangerous thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You amaze me!&rdquo; Sogrange exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all interested in this affair,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;and my friend
      John Dory here is, perhaps, too modest properly to explain the matter. If
      you care to come with me, we can reconstruct, in a minute, the theft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory and Peter Ruff first of all handed over their captive, who was
      now calm and apparently resigned, to the two policemen who were still on
      duty in the Court. Afterwards, Peter Ruff led the way up one flight of
      stairs, and turned the handle of the door of an apartment exactly over the
      morning-room. It was the bedroom of the Marquis de Sogrange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dory&rsquo;s chase in the motor-car,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was, as you have doubtless
      gathered now, merely a blind. It was obvious to his intelligence that the
      blowing away of the window was merely a ruse to cover the real method of
      the theft. If you will allow me, I will show you how it was done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The floor was of hardwood, covered with rugs. One of these, near the
      fireplace, Peter Ruff brushed aside. The seventh square of hardwood from
      the mantelpiece had evidently been tampered with. With very little
      difficulty, he removed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;the ceiling of the room below is also of paneled
      wood. Having removed this, it is easy to lift the second one, especially
      as light screws have been driven in and string threaded about them. There
      is now a hole through which you can see into the room below. Has Dory
      returned? Ah, here he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective came hurrying into the room, bearing in his hand a
      peculiar-shaped weapon, a handful of little darts like those which had
      been found in the wounded man&rsquo;s head, and an ordinary fishing-rod in a
      linen case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the weapon,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, &ldquo;which it was easy enough to fire
      from here upon the man who was leaning forward exactly below. Then here,
      you will see, is a somewhat peculiar instrument, which shows a great deal
      of ingenuity in its details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the linen case, which was, by the bye, secured by a padlock, and
      drew out what was, to all appearance, an ordinary fishing-rod, fitted at
      the end with something that looked like an iron hand. Peter Ruff dropped
      it through the hole until it reached the table, moved it backwards and
      forwards, and turned round with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the theft, after all, was very simple. Personally, I
      must admit that it took me a great deal by surprise, but my friend Mr.
      Dory has been on the right track from the first. I congratulate him most
      heartily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dory was a little overcome. Lady Mary shook him heartily by the hand, but
      as they trooped downstairs she stooped and whispered in Peter Ruff&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how much of this was John Dory,&rdquo; she said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff said nothing. The detective was already on the telephone,
      wiring his report to London. Every one was standing about in little knots,
      discussing this wonderful event. Sogrange sought Lord Clenarvon, and
      walked with him, arm in arm, down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you, Clenarvon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how sorry I am that I should
      have been the means of introducing a person like this to the house. I had
      the most excellent references from the Prince of Strelitz. No doubt they
      were forged. My own man was taken ill just before I left, and I had to
      bring some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Sogrange,&rdquo; Lord Clenarvon said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think of it. What we must
      be thankful for is that we had so brilliant a detective in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As John Dory?&rdquo; Sogrange remarked, with a smile. Lord Clenarvon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we should lose a day&rsquo;s sport because the
      diamonds have been recovered. I always felt that they would turn up again
      some day or other. You are keen, I know, Sogrange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; the Marquis answered. &ldquo;But excuse me for one moment. There is
      Mrs. Ruff looking charming there in the corner. I must have just a word
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the room and bowed before Violet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have come to congratulate you. You have a
      clever husband&mdash;a little cleverer, even, than I thought. I have just
      had the misfortune to lose to him a bet of twenty-five thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Violet smiled, a little uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter doesn&rsquo;t gamble as a rule,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, alas, was no gamble!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He was betting upon certainties,
      but he won. Will you tell him from me, when you see him, that although I
      have not the money in my pocket at the moment, I shall pay my debts. Tell
      him that we are as careful to do that in France as we are to keep our
      word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed, and passed out with the shooting-party on to the terrace. Peter
      Ruff came up, a few minutes later, and his wife gave him the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did that man an injustice,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t explain now, dear. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it later in the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong, is there?&rdquo; she asked him, pleadingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; Peter Ruff declared, &ldquo;everything is right. I have made
      friends with Dory, and I have won a thousand pounds. When we leave here, I
      am going to look out for that little estate in the country. If you come
      out with the lunch, dear, I want you to watch that man Hamilton&rsquo;s coat.
      It&rsquo;s exactly what I should like to wear myself at my own shooting parties.
      See if you can make a sketch of it when he isn&rsquo;t looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Violet laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; she promised.

      CHAPTER I. RECALLED BY THE DOUBLE-FOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is the desire of Madame that you should join our circle here on
      Thursday evening next at ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked up from the sheet of note-paper which he held in his hand,
      and gazed through the open French-windows before which he was standing. It
      was a very pleasant and very peaceful prospect. There was his croquet
      lawn, smooth-shaven, the hoops neatly arranged, the chalk-mark firm and
      distinct upon the boundary. Beyond, the tennis court, the flower gardens,
      and, to the left, the walled fruit garden. A little farther away was the
      paddock and orchard, and a little farther still, the farm, which for the
      last four years had been the joy of his life. His meadows were yellow with
      buttercups; a thin line of willows showed where the brook wound its lazy
      way through the bottom fields. It was a home, this, in which a man could
      well lead a peaceful life, could dream away his days to the music of the
      west wind, the gurgling stream, the song of birds, and the low murmuring
      of insects. Peter Ruff stood like a man turned to stone, for, even as he
      looked, these things passed away from before his eyes, the roar of the
      world beat in his ears&mdash;the world of intrigue, of crime, the world
      where the strong man hewed his way to power, and the weaklings fell like
      corn before the sickle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the desire of Madame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff clenched his fists as he stood there. It was a message from a
      world every memory of which had been deliberately crushed, a world,
      indeed, in which he had seemed no longer to hold any place. Scarcely yet
      of middle age, well-preserved, upright, with neat figure dressed in the
      conventional tweeds and gaiters of an English country gentleman, he not
      only had loved his life, but he looked the part. He was Peter Ruff,
      Esquire, of Aynesford Manor, in the county of Somerset. It could not be
      for him, this strange summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rustle of a woman&rsquo;s soft draperies broke in upon his reverie. He
      turned around with his usual morning greeting upon his lips. If country
      life had agreed with Peter Ruff, it had transformed his wife. Her cheeks
      were no longer pale; the extreme slimness of her figure was no longer
      apparent. She was just a little more matronly, perhaps, but without doubt
      a most beautiful woman. She came smiling across the room&mdash;a dream of
      white muslin and pink ribbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another forage bill, my dear Peter?&rdquo; she demanded, passing her arm
      through his. &ldquo;Put it away and admire my new morning gown. It came straight
      from Paris, and you will have to pay a great deal of money for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled himself together&mdash;he had no secrets from his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, and read aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      RUE DE ST. QUINTAINE. PARIS.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR Mr. RUFF, It is a long time since we had the pleasure of a visit from
      you. It is the desire of Madame that you should join our circle here on
      Thursday evening next at ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      SOGRANGE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violet was a little perplexed. She failed, somehow, to recognize the
      sinister note underlying those few sentences, &ldquo;It sounds friendly enough,&rdquo;
       she remarked. &ldquo;You are not obliged to go, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it sounds all right,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t expect you to take any notice of it, surely?&rdquo; she continued.
      &ldquo;When you bought this place, Peter, and left your London offices, you gave
      them definitely to understand that you had retired into private life, that
      all these things were finished with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some things,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said, slowly, &ldquo;which are never
      finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you resigned,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;I remember your letter distinctly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the Double-Four,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;no resignation is recognized save
      death. I did what I could and they accepted my explanations, gracefully
      and without comment. Now that the time has come, however, when they think
      they need my help, you see they do not hesitate to claim it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not go, Peter? You will not think of going?&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He twisted the letter between his fingers and sat down to his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That morning Peter Ruff spent upon his farm, looking over his stock,
      examining some new machinery, and talking crops with his bailiff. In the
      afternoon he played his customary round of golf. It was the sort of day
      which, as a rule, he found completely satisfactory, yet, somehow or other,
      a certain sense of weariness crept in upon him toward its close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later he received another letter. This time it was couched in
      different terms. On a square card, at the top of which was stamped a small
      coronet, he read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Maupassim at home, Saturday evening, May 2nd, at ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      In small letters at the bottom left-hand corner were added the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      To meet friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff put the card upon the fire and went out for a morning&rsquo;s rabbit
      shooting with his keeper. When he returned luncheon was ready, but Violet
      was absent. He rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your mistress, Jane?&rdquo; he asked the parlor-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had no idea. Mrs. Ruff had left for the village several hours
      before; since then she had not been seen. Peter Ruff ate his luncheon
      alone, and understood. The afternoon wore on, and at night he traveled up
      to London. He knew better than to waste time by purposeless inquiries.
      Instead he took the nine o&rsquo;clock train the next morning to Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a chamber of death into which he was ushered, dismal&mdash;yet, of
      its sort, unique, marvelous. The room itself might have been the sleeping
      apartment of an empress&mdash;lofty, with white paneled walls, adorned
      simply with gilded lines; with high windows, closely curtained now, so
      that neither sound nor the light of day might penetrate into the room. In
      the middle of the apartment upon a canopy bedside, which had once adorned
      a king&rsquo;s palace, lay Madame de Maupassim. Her face was already touched
      with the finger of death, yet her eyes were undimmed and her lips
      unquivering. Her hands, covered with rings, lay out before her upon the
      lace coverlid. Supported by many pillows, she was issuing her last
      instructions with the cold precision of the man of affairs who makes the
      necessary arrangements for a few days, absence from his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff, who had not even been allowed sufficient time to change his
      traveling clothes, was brought without hesitation to her bedside. She
      looked at him in silence for a moment, with a cold glitter in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are four days late, Monsieur Peter Ruff,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Why did you
      not obey your first summons?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I thought there must be a misunderstanding. Four
      years ago, I gave notice to the council that I had married and retired
      into private life. A country farmer is of no further use to the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman&rsquo;s thin lip curled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From death and the Double Four,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there is no resignation which
      counts. You are as much our creature to-day, as I am the creature of the
      disease which is carrying me across the threshold of death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff remained silent. The woman&rsquo;s words seemed full of dread
      significance. Besides, how was it possible to contradict the dying?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is upon the unwilling of the world,&rdquo; she continued, speaking slowly,
      yet with extraordinary distinctness, &ldquo;that its greatest honors are often
      conferred. The name of my successor has been balloted for, secretly. It is
      you, Peter Ruff, who have been chosen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time he was silent because he was literally bereft of words. This
      woman was dying and fancying strange things! He looked from one to the
      other of the stern, pale faces of those who were gathered around her
      bedside. Seven of them there were&mdash;the same seven. At that moment
      their eyes were all focused upon him. Peter Ruff shrank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;this cannot be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips twitched as though she would have smiled. &ldquo;What we have decided,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;we have decided. Nothing can alter that, not even the will of
      Mr. Peter Ruff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been out of the world for four years,&rdquo; Peter Ruff protested. &ldquo;I
      have no longer ambitions, no longer any desire&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; the woman interrupted. &ldquo;You lie or you do yourself an
      injustice. We gave you four years, and looking into your face, I think
      that it has been enough. I think that the weariness is there already. In
      any case, the charge which I lay upon you in these my last moments, is one
      which you can escape by death only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A low murmur of voices from those others repeated her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By death only!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff opened his lips, but closed them again without speech. A wave
      of emotion seemed passing through the room. Something strange was
      happening. It was Death itself, which had come among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A morning journalist wrote of the death of Madame eloquently, and with
      feeling. She had been a broad-minded aristocrat, a woman of brilliant
      intellect and great friendships, a woman of whose inner life during the
      last ten or fifteen years little was known, yet who, in happier times,
      might well have played a great part in the history of her country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff drove back from the cemetery with the Marquis de Sogrange, and,
      for the first time since the death of Madame, serious subjects were spoken
      of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have waited here patiently,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;but there are limits. I want
      my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange took him by the arm and led him into the library of the house in
      the Rue de St. Quintaine. The six men who were already there waiting rose
      to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; the Marquis said, &ldquo;is it your will that I should be
      spokesman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur of assent. Then Sogrange turned toward his companion,
      and something new seemed to have crept into his manner&mdash;a solemn,
      almost a threatening note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Ruff,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you have trifled with the one organization in
      this world which has never allowed liberties to be taken with it. Men who
      have done greater service than you have died, for the disobedience of a
      day. You have been treated leniently, according to the will of Madame.
      According to her will, and in deference to the position which you must now
      take up among us, we will treat you as no other has ever been treated by
      us. The Double-Four admits your leadership and claims you for its own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not prepared to discuss anything of the sort,&rdquo; Peter Ruff declared,
      doggedly, &ldquo;until my wife is restored to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The traditions of your race, Mr. Ruff,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are easily manifest in
      you. Now hear our decision. Your wife shall be restored to you on the day
      when you take up this position to which you have become entitled. Sit down
      and listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff was a rebel at heart, but he felt the grip of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During these four years when you, my friend, have been growing turnips
      and shooting your game, events in the great world have marched, new powers
      have come into being, a new page of history has been opened. As everything
      which has good at the heart evolves toward the good, so we of the
      Double-Four have lifted our great enterprise onto a higher plane. The
      world of criminals is still at our beck and call, we still claim the right
      to draw the line between moral theft and immoral honesty, but to-day the
      Double-Four is concerned with greater things. Within the four walls of
      this room, within the hearing of these my brothers, whose fidelity is as
      sure as the stones of Paris, I tell you a great secret. The government of
      our country has craved for our aid and the aid of our organization. It is
      no longer the wealth of the world alone, which we may control, but the
      actual destinies of nations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I suppose you mean to say is,&rdquo; Peter Ruff remarked, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve
      been going in for politics?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put it crudely, my English bull-dog,&rdquo; Sogrange answered, &ldquo;but you are
      right. We are occupied now by affairs of international importance. More
      than once, during the last few month, ours has been the hand which has
      changed the policy of an empire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most interesting,&rdquo; Peter Ruff declared, &ldquo;but so far as I, personally, am
      concerned&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; interrupted the Marquis. &ldquo;Not a hundred yards from the French
      Embassy, in London, there is waiting for you a house and servants no less
      magnificent than the Embassy itself. You will become the ambassador in
      London of the Double-Four, titular head of our association, a personage
      whose power is second to none in your great city. I do not address words
      of caution to you, my friend, because we have satisfied ourselves as to
      your character and capacity before we consented that you should occupy
      your present position. But I ask you to remember this. The will of Madame
      lives even beyond the grave. The spirit which animated her when alive
      breathes still in all of us. In London you will wield a great power. Use
      it for the common good. And, remember this&mdash;the Double-Four has never
      failed, the Double-Four never can fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear you are so confident,&rdquo; Peter Ruff said. &ldquo;Of course, if
      I have to take this thing on, I shall do my best, but if I might venture
      to allude, for a moment, to anything so trifling as my own domestic
      affairs, I am very anxious to know about my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find Mrs. Ruff awaiting you in London,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Your
      address is Porchester House, Porchester Square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do I go there?&rdquo; Peter Ruff asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do I do when I get there?&rdquo; he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For three days,&rdquo; the Marquis told him, &ldquo;you will remain indoors, and give
      audience to whoever may come to you. At the end of that time, you will
      understand a little more of our purpose and our objects&mdash;perhaps,
      even, of our power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see difficulties,&rdquo; Peter Ruff remarked. &ldquo;There will be a good many
      people who will remember me when I had offices in Southampton Row. My
      name, you see, is uncommon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange drew a document from the breast pocket of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you leave this house to-night,&rdquo; he proclaimed, &ldquo;we bid good-by
      forever to Mr. Peter Ruff. You will find in this envelope the title deeds
      of a small property which is our gift to you. Henceforth you will be known
      by the name and title of your estates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Title!&rdquo; Peter Ruff gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will reappear in London,&rdquo; Sogrange continued, &ldquo;as the Baron de
      Grost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;people will find me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to be found out,&rdquo; the Marquis went on, a little wearily.
      &ldquo;Your country life has dulled your wits, Baron. The title and the name are
      justly yours&mdash;they go with the property. For the rest, the history of
      your family, and of your career up to the moment when you enter Porchester
      House to-night, will be inside this packet. You can peruse it upon the
      journey, and remember that we can, at all times, bring a hundred
      witnesses, if necessary, to prove that you are who you declare yourself to
      be. When you get to Charing-Cross, do not forget that it will be the
      carriage and servants of the Baron de Grost which await you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;I suppose I shall get used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Sogrange answered. &ldquo;For the moment, we are passing through a
      quiet time, necessitated by the mortal illness of Madame. You will be able
      to spend the next few weeks in getting used to your new position. You will
      have a great many callers, inspired by us, who will see that you make the
      right acquaintances and that you join the right clubs. At the same time,
      let me warn you always to be ready. There is trouble brewing just now all
      over Europe. In one way or another, we may become involved at any moment.
      The whole machinery of our society will be explained to you by your
      secretary. You will find him already installed at Porchester House. A
      glass of wine, Baron, before you leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ruff glanced at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are my things to pack,&rdquo; he began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your valet is already on the front seat of the automobile which is
      waiting,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;You will find him attentive and trustworthy. The
      clothes which you brought with you we have taken the liberty of dispensing
      with. You will find others in your trunk, and at Porchester House you can
      send for any tailor you choose. One toast, Baron. We drink to the
      Double-Four&mdash;to the great cause!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur of voices. Sogrange lifted once more his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May Peter Ruff rest in peace!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We drink to his ashes. We drink
      long life and prosperity to the Baron de Grost!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. PRINCE ALBERT&rsquo;S CARD DEBTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was half past twelve, and every table at the Berkeley Bridge Club was
      occupied. On the threshold of the principal room a visitor, who was being
      shown around, was asking questions of the secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any gambling here?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid that some of them go a little beyond the club points,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;You see that table against the wall? They are playing shilling
      auction there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The table near the wall was, perhaps, the most silent. The visitor looked
      at it last and most curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the dissipated-looking boy playing there?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Albert of Trent,&rdquo; the secretary answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is the little man, rather like Napoleon, who sits in the
      easy-chair and watches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baron de Grost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of him,&rdquo; the visitor declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a very rich financier who has recently blossomed out in London,&rdquo;
       the secretary said. &ldquo;One sees him everywhere. He has a good-looking wife,
      who is playing in the other room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good-looking wife,&rdquo; the visitor remarked, thoughtfully. &ldquo;But, yes! I
      thank you very much, Mr. Courtledge for showing me round. I will find my
      friends now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away, leaving Courtledge alone, for a minute or two, on the
      threshold of the card room. The secretary&rsquo;s attention was riveted upon the
      table near the wall, and the frown on his face deepened. Just as he was
      moving off, the Baron de Grost rose and joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are playing a little high in here this evening,&rdquo; the latter remarked
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtledge frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had been in the club when they started,&rdquo; he said, gloomily. &ldquo;My
      task is all the more difficult now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron de Grost looked pensively, for a moment, at the cigarette which
      he was carrying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye, Mr. Courtledge,&rdquo; he asked, with apparent irrelevance, &ldquo;what
      was the name of the tall man with whom you were talking just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count von Hern. He was brought in by one of the attaches at the German
      Embassy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baron de Grost passed his arm through the secretary&rsquo;s and led him a little
      way through the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I recognized our friend,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;His presence here this
      evening is quite interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baron de Grost avoided the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Courtledge,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think that you will allow me to ask you
      something without thinking me impertinent. You know that my wife and I
      have taken some interest in Prince Albert. It is on his account, is it
      not, that you look so gloomy to-night, as though you had an execution in
      front of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtledge nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;that we have come to the end of our tether
      with that young man. It&rsquo;s a pity, too, for he isn&rsquo;t a bad sort, and it
      will do the club no good if it gets about. But he hasn&rsquo;t settled up for a
      fortnight, and the matter came before the committee this afternoon. He
      owes one man over seven hundred pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron de Grost listened gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to speak to him to-night?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must. I am instructed by the committee to ask him not to come to the
      club again until he has discharged his obligations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost smoked thoughtfully for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose there is no getting out of it. Don&rsquo;t rub it in
      too thick, though. I mean to have a talk with the boy afterwards, and if I
      am satisfied with what he says, the money will be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Courtledge raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, of course, that he has a very small income and no
      expectations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Baron de Grost answered. &ldquo;At the same time, it is hard to
      forget that he really is a member of the royal house, even though the
      kingdom is a small one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only is the kingdom a small one,&rdquo; Courtledge remarked, &ldquo;but there are
      something like five lives between him and the succession. However, it&rsquo;s
      very good-natured of you, Baron, to think of lending him a hand. I&rsquo;ll let
      him down as lightly as I can. You know him better than any one; I wonder
      if you could make an excuse to send him out of the room? I&rsquo;d rather no one
      saw me talking to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite easy,&rdquo; said the Baron. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rubber was just finishing as De Grost re-entered the room. He touched
      the young man, who had been the subject of their conversation, upon the
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife would like to speak to you for a moment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She is in the
      other room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince Albert rose to his feet. He was looking very pale, and the ash-tray
      in front of him was littered with cigarette ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go and pay my respects to the Baroness,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;It will
      change my luck, perhaps. Au revoir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed out of the room and all eyes followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the Prince been losing again to-night?&rdquo; the Baron asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the three men at the table shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He owes me about five hundred pounds,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and to tell you the
      truth, I&rsquo;d really rather not play any more. I don&rsquo;t mind high points, but
      his doubles are absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not break up the table?&rdquo; the Baron suggested. &ldquo;The boy can scarcely
      afford such stakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strolled out of the room in time to meet the Prince, who was standing
      in the corridor. A glance at his face was sufficient&mdash;the secretary
      had spoken. He would have hurried off, but the Baron intercepted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are leaving, Prince?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; was the somewhat curt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will walk a little way with you, if I may,&rdquo; De Grost continued. &ldquo;My
      wife brought Lady Brownloe, and the brougham only holds two comfortably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince Albert made no reply. He seemed just then scarcely capable of
      speech. When they had reached the pavement, however, the Baron took his
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;how much does it all amount to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince turned towards him with darkening face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew, then,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;that Mr. Courtledge was going to speak to
      me of my debts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sorry to hear that it had become necessary,&rdquo; the Baron answered.
      &ldquo;You must not take it too seriously. You know very well that at a club
      like the Berkeley, which has such a varied membership, card debts must be
      settled on the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine will be settled before mid-day to-morrow,&rdquo; the young man declared,
      sullenly. &ldquo;I am not sure that it may not be to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost was silent for a moment. They had turned into Piccadilly. He
      summoned a taxicab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind coming round to my house and talking to me, for a few
      minutes?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come round later on,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;I have a call to make first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost held open the door of the taxicab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a talk with you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before you make that call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as though you knew where I was going,&rdquo; the Prince remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion made no reply, but the door of the taxicab was still open
      and his hand had fallen ever so slightly upon the other&rsquo;s shoulder. The
      Prince yielded to the stronger will. He stepped inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove in silence to Porchester Square. The Baron led the way through
      into his own private sanctum, and closed the door carefully. Cigars,
      cigarettes, whiskey and soda, and liqueurs were upon the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help yourself, Prince,&rdquo; he begged, &ldquo;and then, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I am
      going to ask you a somewhat impertinent question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince drank the greater part of a whiskey and soda and lit a
      cigarette. Then he set his tumbler down and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baron de Grost,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have been very kind to me since I have had
      the pleasure of your acquaintance. I hope you will not ask me any question
      that I cannot answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; his host declared, &ldquo;the question which I shall ask will
      be one which it will be very much to your advantage to answer. I will put
      it as plainly as possible. You are going, as you admit yourself, to pay
      your card debts to-night or to-morrow morning, and you are certainly not
      going to pay them out of your income. Where is the money coming from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert of Trent seemed suddenly to remember that after all he was of royal
      descent. He drew himself up and bore himself, for a moment, as a Prince
      should.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baron de Grost,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you pass the limits of friendship when you ask
      such a question. I take the liberty of wishing you good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved towards the door. The Baron, however, was in the way&mdash;a
      strong, motionless figure, and his tone, when he spoke again, was
      convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;I speak in your own interests. You have not chosen
      to answer my question. Let me answer it for you. The money to pay your
      debts, and I know not how much besides, was to come from the Government of
      a country with whom none of your name or nationality should willingly have
      dealings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince started violently. The shock caused him to forget his new-found
      dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, in the devil&rsquo;s name, do you know that?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know more,&rdquo; the Baron continued. &ldquo;I know the consideration which you
      were to give for this money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the Prince began plainly to show the terror which had crept into his
      heart&mdash;the terror and the shame. He looked at his host like a man
      dazed with hearing strange things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes to nothing,&rdquo; he said, in a hard, unnatural tone. &ldquo;It is a
      foolish bargain, indeed. Between me and the throne are four lives. My
      promise is not worth the paper it is written upon. I shall never succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, Prince, is probably where you are misinformed,&rdquo; the Baron replied.
      &ldquo;You are just now in disgrace with your family, and you hear from them
      only what the newspapers choose to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything been kept back from me?&rdquo; the Prince asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me this first,&rdquo; De Grost insisted. &ldquo;Am I not right in assuming that
      you have signed a solemn undertaking that, in the event of your succeeding
      to the throne of your country, you will use the whole of your influence
      towards concluding a treaty with a certain Power, one of the provisions of
      which is that that Power shall have free access to any one of your ports
      in the event of war with England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. The Prince clutched the back of the chair
      against which he was leaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing it were true?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It is, after all, an idle
      promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron shook his head slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is no such idle promise as it seems. The man who is
      seeking to trade upon your poverty knew more than he would tell you. You
      may have read in the newspapers that your two cousins are confined to the
      palace with slight colds. The truth has been kept quiet, but it is none
      the less known to a few of us. The so-called cold is really a virulent
      attack of diphtheria, and, according to to-night&rsquo;s reports, neither Prince
      Cyril nor Prince Henry are expected to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; the Prince gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; his host declared. &ldquo;My information can be relied upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince sat down suddenly. He was looking whiter than ever, and very
      scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even then,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;there is John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been out of touch with your family for some months,&rdquo; De Grost
      reminded his visitor. &ldquo;One or two of us, however, know what you, probably,
      will soon hear. Prince John has taken the vows and solemnly resigned,
      before the Archbishop, his heirship. He will be admitted into the Roman
      Catholic Church in a week or two, and will go straight to a monastery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely enough,&rdquo; the Prince gasped. &ldquo;He always wanted to be a monk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see now,&rdquo; the Baron continued, &ldquo;that your friend&rsquo;s generosity was not
      so wonderful a thing. Count von Hern was watching you to-night at the
      Bridge Club. He has gone home; he is waiting now to receive you. Apart
      from that, the man Nisch, with whom you have played so much, is a
      confederate of his, a political tout, not to say a spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brute!&rdquo; Prince Albert muttered. &ldquo;I am obliged to you, Baron, for
      having warned me,&rdquo; he added, rising slowly to his feet. &ldquo;I shall sign
      nothing. There is another way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is another way, indeed, but not the way
      you have in your mind at this moment. I offer you an alternative. I will
      give you notes for the full amount you owe to-night, so that you can, if
      you will, go back to the club direct from here and pay everything&mdash;on
      one condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Condition!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must promise to put your hand to no document which the Count von Hern
      may place before you, and pledge your word that you have no further
      dealings with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you do this for me?&rdquo; the Prince exclaimed. &ldquo;I do not know
      that I shall ever be able to pay you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you succeed to the throne, you will pay me,&rdquo; the Baron de Grost said.
      &ldquo;If you do not succeed, remember that I am a rich man, and that I shall
      miss this money no more than the sixpence which you might throw to a
      crossing-sweeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince was silent. His host unlocked a small cabinet and took from it
      a bundle of notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me the whole amount you owe,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;every penny, mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixteen hundred pounds,&rdquo; was the broken reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Grost counted a little roll and laid it upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two thousand pounds,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Listen, Prince. A name such as
      you bear carries with it certain obligations. Remember that, and try and
      shape your life accordingly. Take my advice&mdash;go back to your own
      country and find some useful occupation there, even if you only rejoin
      your regiment and wear its uniform. The time may come when your country
      will require you, for her work comes sooner or later to every man. You are
      leading a rotten life over here, a life which might have led to disaster
      and dishonor, a life, as you know, which might have ended in your rooms
      to-night with a small bullet hole in your forehead. Brave men do not die
      like that. Take up the money, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron de Grost sent a cipher dispatch to Paris that night, and
      received an answer which pleased him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a small thing,&rdquo; he read, &ldquo;but it is well done. Particulars of a
      matter of grave importance will reach you to-morrow.&rdquo; letter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. THE AMBASSADOR&rsquo;S WIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alone in his study, with fast-locked door, Peter, Baron de Grost, sat
      reading, word by word, with zealous care the despatch from Paris which had
      just been delivered into his hands. From the splendid suite of reception
      rooms which occupied the whole of the left-hand side of the hall came the
      faint sound of music. The street outside was filled with automobiles and
      carriages setting down their guests. Madame was receiving to-night a
      gathering of very distinguished men and women, and it was only for a few
      moments, and on very urgent business indeed, that her husband had dared to
      leave her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room in which he sat was in darkness except for the single heavily
      shaded electric lamp which stood by his elbow. Nevertheless, there was
      sufficient illumination to show that Peter had achieved one, at least, of
      his ambitions. He was wearing court dress, with immaculate black silk
      stockings and diamond buckles upon his shoes. A red ribbon was in his
      buttonhole and a French order hung from his neck. His passion for clothes
      was certainly amply ministered to by the exigencies of his new position.
      Once more he read those last few words of this unexpectedly received
      despatch, read them with a frown upon his forehead and the light of
      trouble in his eyes. For three months he had done nothing but live the
      life of an ordinary man of fashion and wealth. His first task, for which,
      to tell the truth, he had been anxiously waiting, was here before him, and
      he found it little to his liking. Again, he read slowly to himself the
      last paragraph of Sogrange&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      As ever, dear friend, one of the greatest sayings which the men of my race
      have ever perpetrated once more justifies itself&mdash;&ldquo;Cherchez la
      femme!&rdquo; Of Monsieur we have no manner of doubt. We have tested him in
      every way. And to all appearance Madame should also be above suspicion.
      Yet those things of which I have spoken have happened. For two hours this
      morning I was closeted with Picon here. Very reluctantly he has placed the
      matter in my hands. I pass it on to you. It is your first undertaking,
      cher Baron, and I wish you bon fortune. A man of gallantry, as I know you
      are, you may regret that it should be a woman, and a beautiful woman, too,
      against whom the finger must be pointed. Yet, after all, the fates are
      strong and the task is yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      SOGRANGE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music from the reception rooms grew louder and more insistent. Peter
      rose to his feet, and moving to the fireplace, struck a match and
      carefully destroyed the letter which he had been reading. Then he
      straightened himself, glanced for a moment at the mirror, and left the
      room to join his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Baron jests,&rdquo; the lady murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron de Grost shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, no, Madame!&rdquo; he answered earnestly. &ldquo;France has offered us
      nothing more delightful in the whole history of our entente than the loan
      of yourself and your brilliant husband. Monsieur de Lamborne makes history
      among us politically, while Madame&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron sighed, and his companion leaned a little towards him; her dark
      eyes were full of sentimental regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Continue. It is my wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the good friend of Monsieur de Lamborne,&rdquo; the Baron said, and in his
      tone there seemed to lurk some far-away touch of regret, &ldquo;yet Madame knows
      that her conquests here have been many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Ambassador&rsquo;s wife fanned herself and remained silent for a moment, a
      faint smile playing at the corners of her full, curving lips. She was,
      indeed, a very beautiful woman&mdash;elegant, a Parisienne to the
      finger-tips, with pale cheeks, but eyes dark and soft, eyes trained to her
      service, whose flash was an inspiration, whose very droop had set beating
      the hearts of men less susceptible than the Baron de Grost. Her gown was
      magnificent, of amber satin, a color daring, but splendid; the outline of
      her figure, as she leaned slightly back in her seat, might indeed have
      been traced by the inspired finger of some great sculptor. De Grost, whose
      reputation as a man of gallantry was well established, felt the whole
      charm of her presence&mdash;felt, too, the subtle indications of
      preference which she seemed inclined to accord to him. There was nothing
      which eyes could say which hers were not saying during those few minutes.
      The Baron, indeed, glanced around a little nervously. His wife had still
      her moments of unreasonableness; it was just as well that she was engaged
      with some of her guests at the farther end of the apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are trying to turn my head,&rdquo; his beautiful companion whispered. &ldquo;You
      flatter me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not possible,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the fan fluttered for a moment before her face. She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah. Monsieur!&rdquo; she continued, dropping her voice until it scarcely rose
      above a whisper, &ldquo;there are not many men like you. You speak of my husband
      and his political gifts. Yet what, after all, do they amount to? What is
      his position, indeed, if one glanced behind the scenes, compared with
      yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of the Baron de Grost became like a mask. It was as though
      suddenly he had felt the thrill of danger close at hand, danger even in
      that scented atmosphere wherein he sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, Madame!&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;it is you, now, who are pleased to jest.
      Your husband is a great and powerful ambassador. I, unfortunately, have no
      career, no place in life save the place which the possession of a few
      millions gives to a successful financier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed very softly, and again her eyes spoke to him. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she
      murmured, &ldquo;you and I together could make a great alliance, is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he faltered, doubtfully, &ldquo;if one dared hope&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the fire of her eyes, this time not only voluptuous. Was the man
      stupid, she wondered, or only cautious?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that alliance were once concluded,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;one might hope
      for everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it rests only with me,&rdquo; he began, seriously, &ldquo;oh, Madame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed overcome. Madame was gracious, but was he really stupid or only
      very much in earnest?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be one of the world&rsquo;s money kings,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;it is wonderful&mdash;that.
      It is power&mdash;supreme, absolute power. There is nothing beyond, there
      is nothing greater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the Baron, who was watching her closely, caught another gleam in her
      eyes, and he began to understand. He had seen it before among a certain
      type of her countrywomen&mdash;the greed of money. He looked at her jewels
      and he remembered that, for an ambassador, her husband was reputed to be a
      poor man. The cloud of misgiving passed away from him; he settled down to
      the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If money could only buy the desire of one&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes seemed to seek out Monsieur de Lamborne among the moving throngs.
      She laughed softly, and her hand brushed his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money and one other thing, Monsieur le Baron,&rdquo; she whispered in his ear,
      &ldquo;can buy the jewels from a crown&mdash;can buy, even, the heart of a woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A movement of approaching guests caught them up, and parted them for a
      time. The Baroness de Grost was at home from ten till one, and her rooms
      were crowded. The Baron found himself drawn on one side, a few minutes
      later, by Monsieur de Lamborne himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been looking for you, De Grost,&rdquo; the latter declared. &ldquo;Where can
      we talk for a moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His host took the ambassador by the arm and led him into a retired corner.
      Monsieur de Lamborne was a tall, slight man, somewhat cadaverous looking,
      with large features, hollow eyes, thin but carefully arranged gray hair,
      and a pointed gray beard. He wore a frilled shirt, and an eye-glass
      suspended by a broad black ribbon hung down upon his chest. His face, as a
      rule, was imperturbable enough, but he had the air, just now, of a man
      greatly disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot be overheard here,&rdquo; De Grost remarked. &ldquo;It must be an affair of
      a few words only, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Lamborne wasted no time in preliminaries. &ldquo;This afternoon,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I received from my Government papers of immense importance, which I
      am to hand over to your Foreign Minister at eleven o&rsquo;clock to-morrow
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Lamborne&rsquo;s thin fingers trembled as they played nervously with the
      ribbon of his eye-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he continued, dropping his voice a little. &ldquo;Bernadine has
      undertaken to send a copy of their contents to Berlin by to-morrow night&rsquo;s
      mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ambassador hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We, too, have spies at work,&rdquo; he remarked, grimly. &ldquo;Bernadine wrote and
      sent a messenger with the letter to Berlin. The man&rsquo;s body is drifting
      down the Channel, but the letter is in my pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter from Bernadine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply that a verbatim copy of the document in question will be
      despatched to Berlin to-morrow evening, without fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no secrets between us,&rdquo; De Grost declared, smoothly. &ldquo;What is
      the special importance of this document?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Lamborne shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you ask,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will tell you. You know of the slight
      coolness which there has been between our respective Governments. Our
      people have felt that the policy of your ministers in expending all their
      energies and resources in the building of a great fleet to the utter
      neglect of your army is a wholly one-sided arrangement, so far as we are
      concerned. In the event of a simultaneous attack by Germany upon France
      and England, you would be utterly powerless to render us any measure of
      assistance. If Germany should attack England alone, it is the wish of your
      Government that we should be pledged to occupy Alsace-Lorraine. You, on
      the other hand, could do nothing for us, if Germany&rsquo;s first move were made
      against France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron was deeply interested, although the matter was no new one to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;I am waiting for you to tell me the specific
      contents of this document.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The English Government has asked us two questions: first, how many
      complete army corps we consider she ought to place at our disposal in this
      eventuality; and, secondly, at what point should we expect them to be
      concentrated. The despatch which I received to-night contains the reply to
      these questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which Bernadine has promised to forward to Berlin to-morrow night,&rdquo; the
      Baron remarked, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Lamborne nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You perceive,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the immense importance of the affair. The very
      existence of that document is almost a casus belli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what time did the despatch arrive,&rdquo; the Baron asked, &ldquo;and what has
      been its history since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It arrived at six o&rsquo;clock, and went straight into the inner pocket of my
      coat; it has not been out of my possession for a single second. Even while
      I talk to you I can feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your plans? How are you intending to dispose of it to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my return to the Embassy I shall place it in the safe, lock it up, and
      remain watching it until morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much chance for Bernadine,&rdquo; the Baron remarked,
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there must be no chance&mdash;no chance at all,&rdquo; Monsieur de Lamborne
      asserted, with a note of passion in his thin voice. &ldquo;It is incredible,
      preposterous, that he should even make the attempt. I want you to come
      home with me and share my vigil. You shall be my witness in case anything
      happens. We will watch together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost reflected for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernadine makes few mistakes,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully. Monsieur de
      Lamborne passed his hand across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I not know it?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;In this instance, though, it seems
      impossible for him to succeed. The time is so short and the conditions so
      difficult. I may count upon your assistance, Baron?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron drew from his pocket a crumpled piece of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I received a telegram from headquarters this after noon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with
      instructions to place myself entirely at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will return with me, then, to the Embassy?&rdquo; Monsieur de Lamborne
      asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron de Grost did not at once reply. He was standing in one of his
      characteristic attitudes, his hands clasped behind him, his head a little
      thrust forward, watching with every appearance of courteous interest the
      roomful of guests, stationary just now, listening to the performance of a
      famous violinist. It was, perhaps, by accident that his eyes met those of
      Madame de Lamborne, but she smiled at him subtly, more, perhaps, with her
      wonderful eyes than her lips themselves. She was the centre of a very
      brilliant group, a most beautiful woman holding court, as was only right
      and proper, among her admirers. The Baron sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall not return with you, De Lamborne. I want you to
      follow my suggestions, if you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, assuredly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave here early and go to your club. Remain there until one, then come
      to the Embassy. I shall be there awaiting your arrival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that you will go there alone? I do not understand,&rdquo; the
      ambassador protested. &ldquo;Why should I go to my club? I do not at all
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, do as I say,&rdquo; De Grost insisted. &ldquo;For the present, excuse
      me. I must look after my guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The music had ceased, there was a movement toward the supper-room. The
      Baron offered his arm to Madame de Lamborne, who welcomed him with a
      brilliant smile. Her husband, although, for a Frenchman, he was by no
      means of a jealous disposition, was conscious of a vague feeling of
      uneasiness as he watched them pass out of the room together. A few minutes
      later he made his excuses to his wife and with a reluctance for which he
      could scarcely account left the house. There was something in the air, he
      felt, which he did not understand. He would not have admitted it to
      himself, but he more than half divined the truth. The vacant seat in his
      wife&rsquo;s carriage was filled that night by the Baron de Grost.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o&rsquo;clock precisely Monsieur de Lamborne returned to his house and
      heard with well-simulated interest that Monsieur le Baron de Grost awaited
      his arrival in the library. He found De Grost gazing with obvious respect
      at the ponderous safe let into the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very fine affair&mdash;this,&rdquo; he remarked, motioning with his head
      toward it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best of its kind,&rdquo; Monsieur de Lamborne admitted. &ldquo;No burglar yet has
      ever succeeded in opening one of its type. Here is the packet,&rdquo; he added,
      drawing the document from his pocket. &ldquo;You shall see me place it in safety
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron stretched out his hand and examined the sealed envelope for a
      moment closely. Then he moved to the writing-table, and, placing it upon
      the letter scales, made a note of its exact weight. Finally, he watched it
      deposited in the ponderous safe, suggested the word to which the lock was
      set, and closed the door. Monsieur de Lamborne heaved a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy this time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that our friends at Berlin will be
      disappointed. Couch or easy-chair, Baron?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The couch, if you please,&rdquo; De Grost replied, &ldquo;a strong cigar, and a long
      whiskey and soda. So! Now, for our vigil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hours crawled away. Once De Grost sat up and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any rats about?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ambassador was indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never heard one in my life,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;This is quite a modern
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost dropped his match-box and stooped to pick it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any lights on anywhere, except in this room?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Monsieur de Lamborne answered. &ldquo;It is past three o&rsquo;clock,
      and every one has gone to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron rose and softly unbolted the door. The passage outside was in
      darkness. He listened intently, for a moment, and returned, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One fancies things,&rdquo; he murmured, apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For example?&rdquo; De Lamborne demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One mistakes,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;The nerves become over sensitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dawn broke and the awakening hum of the city grew louder and louder.
      De Grost rose and stretched himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your servants are moving about in the house,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I think that
      we might consider our vigil at an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Lamborne rose with alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I feel that I have made false pretenses to you.
      With the day I have no fear. A thousand pardons for your sleepless night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sleepless night counts for nothing,&rdquo; the Baron assured him, &ldquo;but,
      before I go, would it not be as well that we glance together inside the
      safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Lamborne shook out his keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to suggest it,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ambassador arranged the combination and pressed the lever. Slowly the
      great door swung back. The two men peered in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Untouched!&rdquo; De Lamborne exclaimed, a little note of triumph in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Grost said nothing, but held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me,&rdquo; he interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Lamborne was conscious of a faint sense of uneasiness. His companion
      walked across the room and carefully weighed the packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; De Lamborne cried. &ldquo;Why do you do that? What is wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron turned and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is not the same packet.&rdquo; The ambassador stared
      at him incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are jesting!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Miracles do not happen. The thing is
      impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the impossible, then, which has happened,&rdquo; De Grost replied,
      swiftly. &ldquo;This packet can scarcely have gained two ounces in the night.
      Besides, the seal is fuller. I have an eye for these details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Lamborne leaned against the back of the table. His eyes were a little
      wild, but he laughed hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We fight, then, against the creatures of another world,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;No
      human being could have opened that safe last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Lamborne,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the room adjoining is your wife&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the salon of Madame,&rdquo; the ambassador admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the electrical appliances doing there?&rdquo; the Baron demanded.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me like that, De Lamborne. Remember that I was here before
      you arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife takes an electric massage every day,&rdquo; Monsieur de Lamborne
      answered, in a hard, unnatural voice. &ldquo;In what way is Monsieur le Baron
      concerned in my wife&rsquo;s doings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that there need be no answer to that question,&rdquo; De Grost said,
      quietly. &ldquo;It is a greater tragedy which we have to face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quick as lightning, the Frenchman&rsquo;s hand shot out. De Grost barely avoided
      the blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall answer to me for this, sir,&rdquo; De Lamborne cried. &ldquo;It is the
      honor of my wife which you assail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I maintain only,&rdquo; the Baron answered, &ldquo;that your safe was entered from
      that room. A search will prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no search there,&rdquo; De Lamborne declared, fiercely. &ldquo;I am the
      Ambassador of France, and my power under this roof is absolute. I say that
      you shall not cross that threshold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost&rsquo;s expression did not change. Only his hands were suddenly
      outstretched with a curious gesture&mdash;the four fingers were raised,
      the thumbs depressed. Monsieur De Lamborne collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I submit,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It is you who are the master. Search where you
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur has arrived?&rdquo; the woman demanded, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor of the restaurant himself bowed a reply. His client was
      evidently well-known to him. He answered her in French&mdash;French, with
      a very guttural accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur has ascended some few minutes ago. Myself, I have not had the
      pleasure of wishing him bon aperitif, but Fritz announced his coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman drew a little sigh of relief. A vague misgiving had troubled her
      during the last few hours. She raised her veil as she mounted the narrow
      staircase which led to the one private room at the Hotel de Lorraine. She
      entered, without tapping, the room at the head of the stairs, pushing open
      the ill-varnished door with its white-curtained top. At first she thought
      that the little apartment was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo; she exclaimed, advancing a few steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure of a man glided from behind the worn screen close by her side,
      and stood between her and the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; De Grost said, bowing low.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then she scarcely realized that she was trapped. &ldquo;You?&rdquo; she cried.
      &ldquo;You, Baron? But I do not understand. You have followed me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, Madame,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have preceded you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her colossal vanity triumphed over her natural astuteness. The man had
      employed spies to watch her! He had lost his head. It was an awkward
      matter, this, but it was to be arranged. She held out her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let me beg you now to go away. If you care to, come
      and see me this evening. I will explain everything. It is a little family
      affair which brings me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A family affair, Madame, with Bernadine, the enemy of France,&rdquo; De Grost
      declared, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She collapsed miserably, her fingers grasping at the air, the cry which
      broke from her lips harsh and unnatural. Before he could tell what was
      happening, she was on her knees before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare me,&rdquo; she begged, trying to seize his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; De Grost answered, &ldquo;I am not your judge. You will kindly hand
      over to me the document which you are carrying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took it from the bosom of her dress. De Grost glanced at it, and
      placed it in his breast-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Grost sighed&mdash;she was a very beautiful woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the career of a spy is, as you have doubtless
      sometimes realized, a dangerous one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is finished,&rdquo; she assured him, breathlessly. &ldquo;Monsieur le Baron, you
      will keep my secret? Never again, I swear it, will I sin like this. You,
      yourself, shall be the trustee of my honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes and arms besought him, but it was surely a changed man&mdash;this.
      There was none of the suaveness, the delicate responsiveness of her late
      host at Porchester House. The man who faced her now possessed the features
      of a sphinx. There was not even pity in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not tell my husband?&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband already knows, Madame,&rdquo; was the quiet reply. &ldquo;Only a few
      hours ago I proved to him whence had come the leakage of so many of our
      secrets lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swayed upon her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will never forgive me,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are others,&rdquo; De Grost declared, &ldquo;who forgive more rarely, even,
      than husbands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden illuminating flash of horror told her the truth. She closed her
      eyes and tried to run from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not be told,&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;I will not hear. I do not know who
      you are. I will live a little longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; De Grost said, &ldquo;the Double-Four wages no war with women, save
      with spies only. The spy has no sex. For the sake of your family, permit
      me to send you back to your husband&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night, two receptions and a dinner party were postponed. All London
      was sympathizing with Monsieur de Lamborne, and a great many women swore
      never again to take a sleeping draught. Madame de Lamborne lay dead behind
      the shelter of those drawn blinds, and by her side an empty phial.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE MAN PROM THE OLD TESTAMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bernadine, sometimes called the Count von Hern, was lunching at the Savoy
      with the pretty wife of a Cabinet Minister, who was just sufficiently
      conscious of the impropriety of her action to render the situation
      interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would tell me, Count von Hern,&rdquo; she said, soon after they had
      settled down in their places, &ldquo;why my husband seems to object to you so
      much. I simply dared not tell him that we were going to lunch together,
      and as a rule he doesn&rsquo;t mind what I do in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine smiled slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;your husband is a politician and a very cautious
      man. I dare say he is like some of those others, who believe that, because
      I am a foreigner and live in London, therefore I am a spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a spy,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why nonsense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders. She was certainly a very pretty woman, and her
      black gown set off to fullest advantage her deep red hair and fair
      complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose because I can&rsquo;t imagine you anything of the sort,&rdquo; she
      declared. &ldquo;You see, you hunt and play polo, and do everything which the
      ordinary Englishmen do. Then one meets you everywhere. I think, Count von
      Hern, that you are much too spoilt, for one thing, to take life
      seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me an injustice,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she chattered on, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know what spies do. One
      reads about them in these silly stories, but I have never felt sure that
      as live people they exist at all. Tell me, Count, what could a foreign spy
      do in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine twirled his fair moustache and shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, my dear lady,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;I scarcely know what a spy could do
      nowadays. A few years ago, you English people were all so trusting. Your
      fortifications, your battleships, not to speak of your country itself,
      were wholly at the disposal of the enterprising foreigner who desired to
      acquire information. The party who governed Great Britain then seemed to
      have some strange idea that these things made for peace. To-day, however,
      all that is changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know something about it,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid that mine is really only the superficial point of view,&rdquo; he
      answered, &ldquo;but I do know that there is a good deal of information, which
      seems absolutely insignificant in itself, for which some foreign countries
      are willing to pay. For instance, there was a Cabinet Council yesterday, I
      believe, and some one was going to suggest that a secret, but official,
      visit be paid to your new harbor works up at Rosyth. An announcement will
      probably be made in the papers during the next few days as to whether the
      visit is to be undertaken or not. Yet there are countries who are willing
      to pay for knowing even such an insignificant item of news as that, a few
      hours before the rest of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Maxwell laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I could earn that little sum of money,&rdquo; she declared gayly, &ldquo;for my
      husband has just made me cancel a dinner-party for next Thursday, because
      he has to go up to the stupid place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine smiled. It was really a very unimportant matter, but he loved to
      feel, even in his idle moments, that he was not altogether wasting his
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I am not myself acquainted with one of these
      mythical personages that I might return you the value of your marvelous
      information. If I dared think, however, that it would be in any way
      acceptable, I could offer you the diversion of a restaurant dinner-party
      for that night. The Duchess of Castleford has kindly offered to act as
      hostess for me and we are all going on to the Gaiety afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delightful!&rdquo; Lady Maxwell exclaimed. &ldquo;I should love to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have, then, dear lady, fulfilled your destiny,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have
      given secret information to a foreign person of mysterious identity, and
      accepted payment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, Bernadine was a man of easy manners and unruffled composure. To the
      natural insouciance of his aristocratic bringing up, he had added the
      steely reserve of a man moving in the large world, engaged more often than
      not in some hazardous enterprise. Yet, for once in his life, and in the
      midst of the idlest of conversations, he gave himself away so utterly that
      even this woman with whom he was lunching&mdash;a very butterfly lady,
      indeed could not fail to perceive it. She looked at him in something like
      astonishment. Without the slightest warning his face had become set in a
      rigid stare, his eyes were filled with the expression of a man who sees
      into another world. The healthy color faded from his cheeks, he was white
      even to the parted lips, the wine dripped from his raised glass onto the
      tablecloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, whatever is the matter with you?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Is it a ghost that
      you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine&rsquo;s effort was superb, but he was too clever to deny the shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ghost, indeed,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;the ghost of a man whom every newspaper
      in Europe has declared to be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes followed his. The two people who were being ushered to a seat in
      their immediate vicinity were certainly of somewhat unusual appearance.
      The man was tall, and thin as a lath, and he wore the clothes of the
      fashionable world without awkwardness, yet with the air of one who was
      wholly unaccustomed to them. His cheek-bones were remarkably high, and
      receded so quickly towards his pointed chin that his cheeks were little
      more than hollows. His eyes were dry and burning, flashing here and there
      as though the man himself were continually oppressed by some furtive fear.
      His thick black hair was short cropped, his forehead high and
      intellectual. He was a strange figure, indeed, in such a gathering, and
      his companion only served to accentuate the anachronisms of his
      appearance. She was, above all things, a woman of the moment&mdash;fair,
      almost florid, a little thick-set, with tightly-laced, yet passable
      figure. Her eyes were blue, her hair light-colored. She wore magnificent
      furs, and, as she threw aside her boa, she disclosed a mass of jewelry
      around her neck and upon her bosom, almost barbaric in its profusion and
      setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an extraordinary couple!&rdquo; Lady Maxwell whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man looks as though he had stepped out of the Old Testament,&rdquo; he
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Maxwell&rsquo;s interest was purely feminine, and was riveted now upon the
      jewelry worn by the woman. Bernadine, under the mask of his habitual
      indifference, which had easily reassumed, seemed to be looking away out of
      the restaurant into the great square of a half-savage city, looking at
      that marvelous crowd, numbered by their thousands, even by their hundreds
      of thousands, of men and women whose arms flashed out toward the snow-hung
      heavens, whose lips were parted in one chorus of rapturous acclamation;
      looking beyond them to the tall, emaciated form of the bare-headed priest
      in his long robes, his wind-tossed hair and wild eyes, standing alone
      before that multitude, in danger of death, or worse, at any moment&mdash;their
      idol, their hero. And again, as the memories came flooding into his brain,
      the scene passed away, and he saw the bare room with its whitewashed walls
      and blocked-up windows; he felt the darkness, lit only by those flickering
      candles. He saw the white, passion-wrung faces of the men who clustered
      together around the rude table, waiting; he heard their murmurs, he saw
      the fear born in their eyes. It was the night when their leader did not
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine poured himself out a glass of wine and drank it slowly. The
      mists were clearing away now. He was in London, at the Savoy Restaurant,
      and within a few yards of him sat the man with whose name all Europe once
      had rung&mdash;the man hailed by some as martyr, and loathed by others as
      the most fiendish Judas who ever drew breath. Bernadine was not concerned
      with the moral side of this strange encounter. How best to use his
      knowledge of this man&rsquo;s identity was the question which beat upon his
      brain. What use could be made of him, what profit for his country and
      himself? And then a fear&mdash;a sudden, startling fear. Little profit,
      perhaps, to be made, but the danger&mdash;the danger of this man alive
      with such secrets locked in his bosom! The thought itself was terrifying,
      and even as he realized it a significant thing happened&mdash;he caught
      the eye of the Baron de Grost, lunching alone at a small table just inside
      the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not at all amusing,&rdquo; his guest declared. &ldquo;It is nearly five
      minutes since you have spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, too, have been absorbed,&rdquo; he reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that woman&rsquo;s jewels,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I never saw anything more
      wonderful. The people are not English, of course. I wonder where they come
      from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the Eastern countries, without a doubt,&rdquo; he replied, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Maxwell sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a peculiar-looking man,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but one could put up with a
      good deal for jewels like that. What are you doing this afternoon&mdash;picture-galleries
      or your club?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither, unfortunately,&rdquo; Bernadine answered. &ldquo;I have promised to go with
      a friend to look at some polo ponies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;that we have never been to see those
      Japanese prints yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gallery is closed until Monday,&rdquo; he assured her, falsely. &ldquo;If you
      will honor me then, I shall be delighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders but said nothing. She had an idea that she was
      being dismissed, but Bernadine, without the least appearance of hurry,
      gave her no opportunity for any further suggestions. He handed her into
      the automobile, and returned at once into the restaurant. He touched Baron
      de Grost upon the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, the enemy!&rdquo; he exclaimed, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your service in either capacity,&rdquo; the Baron replied. Bernadine made a
      grimace and accepted the chair which De Grost had indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I may, I will take my coffee with you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am growing old. It
      does not amuse me so much to lunch with a pretty woman. One has to
      entertain, and one forgets the serious business of lunching. I will take
      my coffee and cigarettes in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost gave an order to the waiter and leaned back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;tell me exactly what it is that has brought you back
      into the restaurant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not the pleasure of this few minutes&rsquo; conversation with you?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron carefully selected a cigar, and lit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;goes well, but there are other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost leaned back in his chair, and watched the smoke of his cigar curl
      upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One talks too much,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Before the cards are upon the table,
      it is not wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They chatted upon various matters. De Grost himself seemed in no hurry to
      depart, nor did his companion show any signs of impatience. It was not
      until the two people whose entrance had had such a remarkable effect upon
      Bernadine, rose to leave, that the mask was, for a moment, lifted. De
      Grost had called for his bill and paid it. The two men strolled out
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baron,&rdquo; Bernadine said, suavely, linking his arm through the other man&rsquo;s
      as they passed into the foyer, &ldquo;there are times when candor even among
      enemies becomes an admirable quality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those times, I imagine,&rdquo; De Grost answered, grimly, &ldquo;are rare. Besides,
      who is to tell the real thing from the false?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do less than justice to your perceptions, my friend,&rdquo; Bernadine
      declared, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Grost merely shrugged his shoulders. Bernadine persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;since you doubt me, let me be the first to give you
      a proof that on this occasion, at any rate, I am candor itself. You had a
      purpose in lunching at the Savoy to-day. That purpose I have discovered by
      accident. We are both interested in those people.&rdquo; The Baron de Grost
      shook his head slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me finish,&rdquo; Bernadine insisted. &ldquo;Perhaps when you have heard all that
      I have to say, you may change your attitude. We are interested in the same
      people, but in different ways. If we both move from opposite directions,
      our friend will vanish&mdash;he is clever enough at disappearing, as he
      has proved before. We do not want the same thing from him, I am convinced
      of that. Let us move together and made sure that he does not evade us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it an alliance which you are proposing?&rdquo; De Grost asked, with a quiet
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Enemies have united before to-day against a common foe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost looked across the palm court to where the two people who formed
      the subject of their discussion were sitting in a corner, both smoking,
      both sipping some red-colored liqueur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Bernadine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am much too afraid of you to listen any
      more. You fancy because this man&rsquo;s presence here was an entire surprise to
      you, and because you find me already on his track, that I know more than
      you do and that an alliance with me would be to your advantage. You would
      try to persuade me that your object with him would not be my object.
      Listen. I am afraid of you&mdash;you are too clever for me. I am going to
      leave you in sole possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost&rsquo;s tone was final and his bow valedictory. Bernadine watched him
      stroll in a leisurely way through the foyer, exchanging greetings here and
      there with friends, watched him enter the cloakroom, from which he emerged
      with his hat and overcoat, watched him step into his automobile and leave
      the restaurant. He turned back with a clouded face, and threw himself into
      an easy chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes passed uneventfully. People were passing backwards and
      forwards all the time, but Bernadine, through his half-closed eyes, did
      little save watch the couple in whom he was so deeply interested. At last
      the man rose, and, with a word of farewell to his companion, came out from
      the lounge, and made his way up the foyer, turning toward the hotel. He
      walked with quick, nervous strides, glancing now and then restlessly about
      him. In his eyes, to those who understood, there was the furtive gleam of
      the hunted man. It was the passing of one who was afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman, left to herself, began to look around her with some curiosity.
      Bernadine, to whom a new idea had occurred, moved his chair nearer to
      hers, and was rewarded by a glance which certainly betrayed some interest.
      A swift and unerring judge in such matters, he came to the instant
      conclusion that she was not unapproachable. He acted immediately and upon
      impulse. Rising to his feet, he approached her, and bowed easily but
      respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is impossible that I am mistaken. I have had the
      pleasure, have I not, of meeting you in St. Petersburg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her first reception of his coming was reassuring enough. At his mention of
      St. Petersburg, however, she frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think so,&rdquo; she answered, in French. &ldquo;You are mistaken. I do not
      know St. Petersburg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was in Paris,&rdquo; Bernadine continued, with conviction. &ldquo;Madame is
      Parisian, without a doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think that I remember meeting you, Monsieur,&rdquo; she replied,
      doubtfully, &ldquo;but perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, and her eyes dropped before his. He was certainly a very
      personable looking man, and she had spoken to no one for so many months.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, Madame, I could not possibly be mistaken,&rdquo; Bernadine assured
      her, smoothly. &ldquo;You are staying here for long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;My husband he has, I think, what you call
      the wander fever. For myself, I am tired of it. In Rome we settle down, we
      stay five days, all seems pleasant, and suddenly my husband&rsquo;s whim carries
      us away without an hour&rsquo;s notice. The same thing at Monte Carlo, the same
      in Paris. Who can tell what will happen here? To tell you the truth,
      Monsieur,&rdquo; she added, a little archly, &ldquo;I think that if he were to come
      back at this moment, we should probably leave England to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband is very jealous?&rdquo; Bernadine whispered, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly jealous, and partly, he has the most terrible distaste for
      acquaintances. He will not speak to strangers himself, or suffer me to do
      so. It is sometimes&mdash;oh! it is sometimes very triste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame has my sympathy,&rdquo; Bernadine assured her. &ldquo;It is an impossible life&mdash;this.
      No husband should be so exacting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with her round, blue eyes, a touch of added color in her
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one could but cure him!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would ask your permission to sit down,&rdquo; Bernadine remarked, &ldquo;but I fear
      to intrude. You are afraid, perhaps, that your husband may return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be better that you do not stay,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;For a moment or
      two he is engaged. He has an appointment in his room with a gentleman, but
      one never knows how long he may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have friends in London, then,&rdquo; Bernadine remarked, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my husband&rsquo;s affairs,&rdquo; the woman said, &ldquo;there is no one so ignorant as
      I. Yet since we left our own country, this is the first time I have known
      him willingly speak to a soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own country,&rdquo; Bernadine repeated, softly. &ldquo;That was Russia, of
      course. Your husband&rsquo;s nationality is very apparent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked a little annoyed with herself. She remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I not hope,&rdquo; Bernadine begged, &ldquo;that you will give me the pleasure of
      meeting you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not leave me,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I am not alone for five minutes
      during the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine scribbled the name by which he was known in that locality, on a
      card, and passed it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have rooms in St. James&rsquo;s Street, quite close to here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If
      you could come and have tea with me to-day or to-morrow, it would give me
      the utmost pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the card, and crumpled it in her hand. All the time, though, she
      shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is very kind,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I am afraid&mdash;I do not think
      that it would be possible. And now, if you please, you must go away. I am
      terrified lest my husband should return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine bent low in a parting salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;you will come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine was a handsome man, and he knew well enough how to use his soft
      and extraordinarily musical voice. He knew very well, as he retired, that
      somehow or other she would accept his invitation. Even then, he felt
      dissatisfied and ill at ease, as he left the place. He had made a little
      progress, but, after all, was it worth while? Supposing that the man with
      whom her husband was even at this moment closeted, was the Baron de Grost!
      He called a taxicab and drove at once to the Embassy of his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at that moment, De Grost and the Russian&mdash;Paul Hagon he called
      himself&mdash;were standing face to face in the latter&rsquo;s sitting-room. No
      conventional greetings of any sort had been exchanged. De Grost had
      scarcely closed the door behind him before Hagon addressed him
      breathlessly, almost fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, sir,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;and what do you want with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had my letter?&rdquo; De Grost inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had your letter,&rdquo; the other admitted. &ldquo;It told me nothing. You speak of
      business. What business have I with any here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My business is soon told,&rdquo; De Grost replied, &ldquo;but in the first place, I
      beg that you will not unnecessarily alarm yourself. There is, believe me,
      no need for it, no need whatever, although, to prevent misunderstandings,
      I may as well tell you at once that I am perfectly well aware who it is
      that I am addressing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hagon collapsed into a chair. He buried his face in his hands and groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not here necessarily as an enemy,&rdquo; De Grost continued. &ldquo;You have
      very excellent reasons, I make no doubt, for remaining unknown in this
      city, or wherever you may be. As yet, let me assure you that your identity
      is not even suspected, except by myself and one other. Those few who
      believe you alive, believe that you are in America. There is no need for
      any one to know that Father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; the man begged, piteously. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me,&rdquo; the man demanded, &ldquo;what is your price? I have had money.
      There is not much left. Sophia is extravagant and traveling costs a great
      deal. But why do I weary you with these things?&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Let me know
      what I have to pay for your silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a blackmailer,&rdquo; De Grost answered, sternly. &ldquo;I am myself a
      wealthy man. I ask from you nothing in money&mdash;I ask you nothing in
      that way at all. A few words of information, and a certain paper, which I
      believe you have in your possession, is all that I require.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Information,&rdquo; Hagon repeated, shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I ask,&rdquo; De Grost declared, &ldquo;is really a matter of justice. At the
      time when you were the idol of all Russia and the leader of the great
      revolutionary party, you received funds from abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accounted for them,&rdquo; Hagon muttered. &ldquo;Up to a certain point I accounted
      for everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You received funds from the Government of a European power,&rdquo; De Grost
      continued, &ldquo;funds to be applied towards developing the revolution. I want
      the name of that Power, and proof of what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hagon remained motionless for a moment. He had seated himself at the
      table, his head resting upon his hand and his face turned away from De
      Grost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a politician, then?&rdquo; he asked, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a politician,&rdquo; De Grost admitted. &ldquo;I represent a great secret power
      which has sprung into existence during the last few years. Our aim, at
      present, is to bring closer together your country and Great Britain.
      Russia hesitates because an actual rapprochement with us is equivalent to
      a permanent estrangement with Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hagon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone. &ldquo;I have finished with politics. I
      have nothing to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; De Grost persisted, suavely, &ldquo;that you will be better advised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hagon turned round and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;do you believe that I am afraid of death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost looked at him steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;you have proved the contrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my identity is discovered,&rdquo; Hagon continued, &ldquo;I have the means of
      instant death at hand. I do not use it because of my love for the one
      person who links me to this world. For her sake I live, and for her sake I
      bear always the memory of the shameful past. Publish my name and
      whereabouts, if you will. I promise you that I will make the tragedy
      complete. But for the rest, I refuse to pay your price. A great power
      trusted me, and whatever its motives may have been, its money came very
      near indeed to freeing my people. I have nothing more to say to you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron de Grost was taken aback. He had scarcely contemplated refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must understand,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that this is not a personal matter.
      Even if I myself would spare you, those who are more powerful than I will
      strike. The society to which I belong does not tolerate failure. I am
      empowered even to offer you its protection, if you will give me the
      information for which I ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hagon rose to his feet, and, before De Grost could foresee his purpose,
      had rung the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My decision is unchanging,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can pull down the roof upon my
      head, but I carry next my heart an instant and unfailing means of escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A waiter stood in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will take this gentleman to the lift,&rdquo; Hagon directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was once more a touch in his manner of that half divine authority
      which had thrilled the great multitude of his believers. De Grost was
      forced to admit defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not defeat,&rdquo; he said to himself, as he followed the man to the lift,
      &ldquo;only a check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, it was a serious check. He could not, for the moment, see
      his way further. Arrived at his house, he followed his usual custom and
      made his way at once to his wife&rsquo;s rooms. Violet was resting upon a sofa,
      but laid down her book at his entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;I have come for your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He refuses, then?&rdquo; she asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely. What am I to do? Bernadine is already upon the scent. He saw
      him at the Savoy to-day, and recognized him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Bernadine approached him yet?&rdquo; Violet inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. He is half afraid to move. I think he realizes, or will very
      soon, how serious this man&rsquo;s existence may be for Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Violet was thoughtful for several moments, then she looked up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernadine will try the woman,&rdquo; she asserted. &ldquo;You say that Hagon is
      infatuated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blindly,&rdquo; De Grost replied. &ldquo;He scarcely lets her out of his sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your people watch Bernadine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; Violet went on, &ldquo;you will find that he will attempt an
      intrigue with the woman. The rest should be easy for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost sighed as he bent over his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is no subtlety like the subtlety of a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine&rsquo;s instinct had not deceived him, and the following afternoon his
      servant, who had already received orders, silently ushered Madame Hagon
      into his apartments. She was wrapped in magnificent sables and heavily
      veiled. Bernadine saw at once that she was very nervous and wholly
      terrified. He welcomed her in as matter-of-fact a manner as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;this is quite charming of you. You must sit in my
      easy-chair here, and my man shall bring us some tea. I drink mine always
      after the fashion of your country, with lemon, but I doubt whether we make
      it so well. Won&rsquo;t you unfasten your jacket? I am afraid that my rooms are
      rather warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame had collected herself, but it was quite obvious that she was unused
      to adventures of this sort. Her hand, when he took it, trembled, and more
      than once she glanced furtively toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have come,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I do not know why. It is not right for
      me to come. Yet there are times when I am weary, times when Paul seems
      fierce and when I am terrified. Sometimes I even wish that I were back&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband seems very highly strung,&rdquo; Bernadine remarked. &ldquo;He has
      doubtless led an exciting life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; she replied, gazing around her now and gradually becoming
      more at her ease, &ldquo;I know but little. He was a student professor at
      Moschaume, when I met him. I think that he was at one of the universities
      in St. Petersburg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine glanced at her covertly. It came to him as an inspiration that
      the woman did not know the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are from Russia, then, after all,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;I felt sure of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; reluctantly. &ldquo;Paul is so queer in these things. He will not let me
      talk of it. He prefers that we are taken for French people. Indeed, it is
      not I who desire to think too much of Russia. It is not a year since my
      father was killed in the riots, and two of my brothers were sent to
      Siberia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine was deeply interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were among the revolutionaries?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He, too, was with them in sympathy. Secretly, too, I believe that he
      worked among them. Only he had to be careful. You see, his position at the
      college made it difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine looked into the woman&rsquo;s eyes and he knew then that she was
      speaking the truth. This man was, indeed, a great master; he had kept her
      in ignorance!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always,&rdquo; Bernadine said, a few minutes later, as he passed her tea, &ldquo;I
      read with the deepest interest of the people&rsquo;s movement in Russia. Tell
      me, what became eventually of their great leader&mdash;the wonderful
      Father Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She set down her cup untasted, and her blue eyes flashed with a fire which
      turned them almost to the color of steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful indeed!&rdquo; she exclaimed &ldquo;Wonderful Judas! It was he who wrecked
      the cause. It was he who sold the lives and liberty of all of us for
      gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard a rumor of that,&rdquo; Bernadine remarked, &ldquo;but I never believed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was true,&rdquo; she declared passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is he now?&rdquo; Bernadine asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; she answered fiercely. &ldquo;Torn to pieces, we believe, one night in a
      house near Moscow. May it be so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment, as though engaged in prayer. Bernadine spoke
      no more of these things. He talked to her kindly, keeping up always his
      role of respectful but hopeful admirer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come again soon?&rdquo; he begged, when, at last, she insisted upon
      going.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so difficult,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;If my husband knew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine laughed, and touched her fingers caressingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need one tell him?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You see, I trust you. I pray that you
      will come-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine was a man rarely moved towards emotion of any sort. Yet even he
      was conscious of a certain sense of excitement, as he stood looking out
      upon the Embankment from the windows of Paul Hagon&rsquo;s sitting-room, a few
      days later. Madame was sitting on the sofa, close at hand. It was for her
      answer to a certain question that he waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said at last, turning slowly towards him, &ldquo;it must be no.
      Indeed, I am sorry, for you have been very charming to me, and without you
      I should have been dull. But to come to your rooms and dine alone
      to-night, it is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband cannot return before the morning, Bernadine reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes no difference,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Paul is sometimes fierce and
      rough, but he is generous, and all his life he has worshiped me. He
      behaves strangely at times, but I know that he cares&mdash;all the time
      more, perhaps, than I deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is no one else,&rdquo; Bernadine asked softly, &ldquo;who can claim even
      the smallest place in your heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; the woman begged, &ldquo;you must not ask me that. I think that you
      had better go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine stood quite still for several moments. It was the climax towards
      which he had steadfastly guided the course of this mild intrigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;you must not send me away. You shall not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must not ask impossible things,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Bernadine took the plunge. He became suddenly very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sophia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am keeping a great secret from you and I can do it
      no longer. When you speak to me of your husband you drive me mad. If I
      believed that you really loved him, I would go away and leave it to chance
      whether or not you ever discovered the truth. As it is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she interposed breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it is,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I am going to tell you now. Your husband has
      deceived you&mdash;he is deceiving you every moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that there is another woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than that,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Your husband stole even your love under
      false pretenses. You think that his life is a strange one, that his nerves
      have broken down, that he flies from place to place for distraction, for
      change of scene. It is not so. He left Rome, he left Nice, he left Paris,
      for one and the same reason. He left because he was in peril of his life.
      I know little of your history, but I know as much as this. If ever a man
      deserved the fate from which he flees, your husband deserves it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am sane,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;It is you who are mad, not to have
      understood. Your husband goes ever in fear of his life. His real name is
      one branded with ignominy throughout the world. The man whom you have
      married, to whom you are so scrupulously faithful, is the man who sent
      your father to death and your brothers to Siberia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Paul!&rdquo; she screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lived with him, you are his wife,&rdquo; Bernadine declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color had left her cheeks; her eyes, with their penciled brows, were
      fixed in an almost ghastly stare; her breath was coming in uneven gasps.
      She looked at him in silent terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not true,&rdquo; she cried at last; &ldquo;it cannot be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sophia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you can prove it for yourself. I know a little of your
      husband and his doings. Does he not carry always with him a black box
      which he will not allow out of his sight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always,&rdquo; she assented. &ldquo;How did you know? By night his hand rests upon
      it. By day, if he goes out, it is in my charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fetch it now,&rdquo; Bernadine directed, &ldquo;and I will prove my words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not hesitate for a moment. She disappeared into the inner room;
      and came back, only a few moments absent, carrying in her hand a black
      leather despatch-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the key?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, looking at him and trembling, &ldquo;but I dare not&mdash;oh,
      I dare not open it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sophia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if my words are not true, I will pass out of your life
      for always. I challenge you. If you open that box you will know that your
      husband is, indeed, the greatest scoundrel in Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a key from a gold chain around her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two locks,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;The other is a combination, but I
      know the word. Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started suddenly. There was a loud tapping at the door. Bernadine
      threw an antimacassar half over the box, but he was too late. De Grost and
      Hagon had crossed the threshold. The woman stood like some dumb creature.
      Hagon, transfixed, stood with his eyes riveted upon Bernadine. His face
      was distorted with passion, he seemed like a man beside himself with fury.
      De Grost came slowly forward into the middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count von Hern,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think that you had better leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman found words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;not yet! Paul, listen to me. This man has told me a
      terrible thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The breath seemed to come through Hagon&rsquo;s teeth like a hiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has told you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;It is the truth which you must tell now.
      He says that you&mdash;you are Father Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hagon did not hesitate for a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a silence&mdash;short, but tragical. Hagon seemed suddenly
      to have collapsed. He was like a man who has just had a stroke. He stood
      muttering to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the end&mdash;this&mdash;the end!&rdquo; he said, in a low tone.
      &ldquo;Sophia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrank away from him. He drew himself up. Once more the great light
      flashed in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was for your sake,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;for your sake, Sophia. I came to
      you poor and you would have nothing to say to me. My love for you burned
      in my veins like fever. It was for you I did it&mdash;for your sake I sold
      my honor, the love of my country, the freedom of my brothers. For your
      sake I risked an awful death. For your sake I have lived like a hunted
      man, with the cry of the wolves always in my ears, and the fear of death
      and of eternal torture with me day by day. No other man since the world
      was made has done more. Have pity on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was unmoved; her face had lost all expression. No one noticed in that
      rapt moment that Bernadine had crept from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was you,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;who killed my father, and sent my brothers into
      exile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help me!&rdquo; he moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to De Grost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him away with you, please,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have finished with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sophia!&rdquo; he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned across the table and struck him heavily upon the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you stay here,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;I shall kill you myself....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night, the body of an unknown foreigner was found in the attic of a
      cheap lodging-house in Soho. The discovery itself and the verdict at the
      inquest occupied only a few lines in the morning newspapers. Those few
      lines were the epitaph of one who was very nearly a Rienzi. The greater
      part of his papers De Grost mercifully destroyed, but one in particular he
      preserved. Within a week the much delayed treaty was signed at Paris,
      London and St. Petersburg.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. THE FIRST SHOT
    </h2>
    <p>
      De Grost and his wife were dining together at the corner table in a
      fashionable but somewhat Bohemian restaurant. Both had been in the humor
      for reminiscences, and they had outstayed most of their neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what people really think of us,&rdquo; Violet remarked pensively. &ldquo;I
      told Lady Amershal, when she asked us to go there this evening, that we
      always dined together alone somewhere once a week, and she absolutely
      refused to believe me. &lsquo;With your own husband, my dear?&rsquo; She kept on
      repeating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her Ladyship&rsquo;s tastes are more catholic,&rdquo; the Baron declared dryly. &ldquo;Yet,
      after all, Violet, the real philosophy of married life demands something
      of this sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Violet smiled and fingered her pearls for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the real philosophy of married life may be I do not know,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;but I am perfectly content with our rendering of it. What a fortunate
      thing, Peter, with your intensely practical turn of mind, that nature
      endowed you with so much sentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost gazed reflectively at the cigarette which he had just selected
      from his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;there have been times when I have cursed myself for
      a fool, but, on the whole, sentiment keeps many fires burning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned towards him and dropped her voice a little. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she
      begged, &ldquo;do you ever think of the years we spent together in the country?
      Do you ever regret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a hard question, that,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;There were days there which I
      loved, but there were days, too, when the restlessness came, days when I
      longed to hear the hum of the city and to hear men speak whose words were
      of life and death and the great passions. I am not sure, Violet, whether,
      after all, it is well for one who has lived to withdraw absolutely from
      the thrill of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, Softly but gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am with you,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;absolutely. I think that the fairies must
      have poured into my blood the joy of living for its own sake. I should be
      an ungrateful woman indeed, if I found anything to complain of, nowadays.
      Yet there is one thing that troubles me,&rdquo; she went on, after a moment&rsquo;s
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The danger,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;I do not want to lose you, Peter. There
      are times when I am afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost flicked the ash from his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The days are passing,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;when men point revolvers at one
      another, and hire assassins to gain their ends. Now, it is more a battle
      of wits. We play chess on the board of Life still, but we play with ivory
      pieces instead of steel and poison. Our brains direct and not our
      muscles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only the one man of whom I am afraid. You have outwitted him so
      often and he does not forgive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost smiled. It was an immense compliment&mdash;this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernadine,&rdquo; he murmured, softly, &ldquo;otherwise, our friend the Count von
      Hern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernadine!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;All that you say is true, but when one fails
      with modern weapons, one changes the form of attack. Bernadine at heart is
      a savage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hate of such a man,&rdquo; De Grost remarked complacently, &ldquo;is worth
      having. He has had his own way over here for years. He seems to have found
      the knack of living in a maze of intrigue and remaining untouchable. There
      were a dozen things before I came upon the scene which ought to have
      ruined him. Yet there never appeared to be anything to take hold of. Even
      the Criminal Department once thought they had a chance. I remember John
      Dory telling me in disgust that Bernadine was like one of those marvelous
      criminals one only reads about in fiction, who seem, when they pass along
      the dangerous places, to walk upon the air, and, leave no trace behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you came,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he had never known a failure. Do you think
      that he is a man likely to forgive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; De Grost answered grimly. &ldquo;It is a battle, of course, a battle
      all the time. Yet, Violet, between you and me, if Bernadine were to go,
      half the savor of life for me would depart with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there came a curious and wholly unexpected interruption. A man in
      dark, plain clothes, still wearing his overcoat, and carrying a bowler
      hat, had been standing in the entrance of the restaurant for a moment or
      two, looking around the room as though in search of some one. At last he
      caught the eye of the Baron de Grost and came quickly toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles,&rdquo; the Baron remarked, raising his eyebrows. &ldquo;I wonder what he
      wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden cloud had fallen upon their little feast. Violet watched the
      coming of her husband&rsquo;s servant, and the reading of the note which he
      presented to his master, with an anxiety which she could not wholly
      conceal. The Baron read the note twice, scrutinizing a certain part of it
      closely with the aid of the monocle which he seldom used. Then he folded
      it up and placed it in the breast pocket of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what hour did you receive this, Charles?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A messenger brought it in a taxicab about ten minutes ago, sir,&rdquo; the man
      replied. &ldquo;He said that it was of the utmost importance, and that I had
      better try and find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A district messenger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man in ordinary clothes,&rdquo; Charles answered. &ldquo;He looked like a porter in
      a warehouse, or something of that sort. I forgot to say that you were rung
      up on the telephone three times previously by Mr. Greening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is no reply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man bowed and retired. De Grost called for his bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it anything serious?&rdquo; Violet inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not exactly serious,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I do not understand what has
      happened, but they have sent for me to go&mdash;well, where it was agreed
      that I should not go except as a matter of urgent necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Violet knew better than to show any signs of disquietude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in London?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; her husband replied. &ldquo;I shall take a taxicab from here. I am
      sorry, dear, to have one of our evenings disturbed in this manner. I have
      always done my best to avoid it, but this summons is urgent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and he wrapped her cloak around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will drive straight home, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I dare say that I
      may be back within an hour myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if not?&rdquo; she asked, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not, there is nothing to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Violet bit her lip, but, as he handed her into the small electric brougham
      which was waiting, she smiled into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come back, and soon, Peter,&rdquo; she declared, confidently.
      &ldquo;Wherever you go I am sure of that. You see, I have faith in my star which
      watches over you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her fingers and turned away. The commissionaire had already
      called him a taxicab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To London Bridge,&rdquo; he ordered, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, and drove
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traffic citywards had long since finished for the day, and he reached
      his destination within ten minutes of leaving the restaurant. Here he paid
      the man, and, entering the station, turned to the refreshment room and
      ordered a liqueur brandy. While he sipped it, he smoked a cigarette and
      carefully reread in a strong light the note which he had received. The
      signature especially he pored over for some time. At last, however, he
      replaced it in his pocket, paid his bill, and, stepping out once more on
      to the platform, entered a telephone booth. A few minutes later he left
      the station, and, turning to the right, walked slowly as far as Tooley
      Street. He kept on the right-hand side until he arrived at the spot where
      the great arches, with their scanty lights, make a gloomy thoroughfare
      into Bermondsey. In the shadow of the first of these he paused, and looked
      steadfastly across the street. There were few people passing and
      practically no traffic. In front of him was a row of warehouses, all save
      one of which was wrapped in complete darkness. It was the one where some
      lights were still burning which De Grost stood and watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights, such as they were, seemed to illuminate the ground floor only.
      From his hidden post he could see the shoulders of a man apparently
      bending over a ledger, diligently writing. At the next window a youth,
      seated upon a tall stool, was engaged in presumably the same occupation.
      There was nothing about the place in the least mysterious or out of the
      way. Even the blinds of the offices had been left undrawn. The man and the
      boy, who were alone visible, seemed, in a sense, to be working under
      protest. Every now and then the former stopped to yawn, and the latter
      performed a difficult balancing feat upon his stool. De Grost, having
      satisfied his curiosity, came presently from his shelter, almost running
      into the arms of a policeman, who looked at him closely. The Baron, who
      had an unlighted cigarette in his mouth, stopped to ask for a light, and
      his appearance at once set at rest any suspicions the policeman might have
      had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a warehouse myself down in these parts,&rdquo; he remarked, as he struck
      the match, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t allow my people to work as late as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed across the way, and the policeman smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very often late there, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Continental wine
      business, and there&rsquo;s always one or two of them over time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad business, all the same,&rdquo; De Grost declared pleasantly. &ldquo;Good
      night, policeman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost crossed the road diagonally, as though about to take the short
      cut across London Bridge, but as soon as the policeman was out of sight he
      retraced his steps to the building which they had been discussing, and
      turning the battered brass handle of the door, walked calmly in. On his
      right and left were counting houses framed with glass; in front, the
      cavernous and ugly depths of a gloomy warehouse. He knocked upon the
      window-pane on the right and passed forward a step or two, as though to
      enter the office. The boy, who had been engaged in the left-hand counting
      house, came gliding from his place, passed silently behind the visitor and
      turned the key of the outer door. What followed seemed to happen as though
      by some mysteriously directed force. The figures of men came stealing out
      from the hidden places. The clerk who had been working so hard at his desk
      calmly divested himself of a false mustache and wig, and, assuming a more
      familiar appearance, strolled out into the warehouse. De Grost looked
      around him with absolutely unruffled composure. He was the centre of a
      little circle of men, respectably dressed, but every one of them
      hard-featured, with something in their faces which suggested not the
      ordinary toiler, but the fighting animal&mdash;the man who lives by his
      wits and knows something of danger. On the outskirts of the circle stood
      Bernadine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; De Grost declared, &ldquo;this is most unexpected. In the matter of
      dramatic surprises, my friend Bernadine, you are certainly in a class by
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will understand, of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this little entertainment
      is entirely for your amusement&mdash;well stage-managed, perhaps, but my
      supers are not to be taken seriously. Since you are here, Baron, might I
      ask you to precede me a few steps to the tasting office?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; De Grost answered cheerfully. &ldquo;It is this way, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked with unconcerned footsteps down the warehouse, on either side of
      which were great bins and a wilderness of racking, until he came to a
      small, glass-enclosed office, built out from the wall. Without hesitation
      he entered it, and removing his hat, selected the more comfortable of the
      two chairs. Bernadine alone of the others followed him inside, closing the
      door behind. De Grost, who appeared exceedingly comfortable, stretched out
      his hand and took a small black bottle from a tiny mahogany racking fixed
      against the wall by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse me, my dear Bernadine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I see my friend
      Greening has been tasting a few wines. The &lsquo;XX&rsquo; upon the label here
      signifies approval. With your permission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He half filled a glass and pushed the bottle toward Bernadine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greening&rsquo;s taste is unimpeachable,&rdquo; De Grost declared, setting down his
      glass empty. &ldquo;No use being a director of a city business, you know, unless
      one interests oneself personally in it. Greening&rsquo;s judgment is simply
      marvelous. I have never tasted a more beautiful wine. If the boom in
      sherry does come,&rdquo; he continued complacently, &ldquo;we shall be in an excellent
      position to deal with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my friend&mdash;Peter Ruff, or Baron de Grost, or whatever you may
      choose to call yourself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am indeed wise to have come to the
      conclusion that you and I are too big to occupy the same little spot on
      earth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost nodded approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was beginning to wonder,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;whether you would not soon
      arrive at that decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having arrived at it,&rdquo; Bernadine continued, looking intently at his
      companion, &ldquo;the logical sequence naturally occurs to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, my dear Bernadine,&rdquo; De Grost asserted. &ldquo;You say to yourself,
      no doubt, &lsquo;One of us two must go!&rsquo; Being yourself, you would naturally
      conclude that it must be I. To tell you the truth, I have been expecting
      some sort of enterprise of this description for a considerable time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your expectations,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;seem scarcely to have provided you with a
      safe conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost gazed reflectively into his empty glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;I am such a lucky person. Your arrangements
      to-night, however, are, I perceive, unusually complete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you appreciate them,&rdquo; Bernadine remarked dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not for a moment,&rdquo; De Grost continued, &ldquo;ask an impertinent or an
      unnecessary question, but I must confess that I am rather concerned to
      know the fate of my manager&mdash;the gentleman whom you yourself with the
      aid, I presume, of Mr. Clarkson, so ably represented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your manager was a very obstinate person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my clerk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incorruptible, absolutely incorruptible. I congratulate you, De Grost.
      Your society is one of the most wonderful upon the face of this earth. I
      know little about it, but my admiration is very sincere. Their attention
      to details, and the personnel of their staff, is almost perfect. I may
      tell you at once that no sum that could be offered, tempted either of
      these men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to hear it,&rdquo; De Grost replied, &ldquo;but I must plead guilty to
      a little temporary anxiety as to their present whereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this moment,&rdquo; Bernadine remarked, &ldquo;they are within a few feet of us,
      but, as you are doubtless aware, access to your delightful river is
      obtainable from these premises. To be frank with you, my dear Baron, we
      are waiting for the tide to rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So thoughtful about these trifles,&rdquo; De Grost murmured. &ldquo;But their present
      position? They are, I trust, not uncomfortable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine stood up and moved to the further end of the office. He beckoned
      his companion to his side and, drawing an electric torch from his pocket,
      flashed the light into a dark corner behind an immense bin. The forms of a
      man and a youth, bound with ropes and gagged, lay stretched upon the
      floor. De Grost sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Mr. Greening, at any rate, is most
      uncomfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine turned off the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, Baron,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;if such extreme measures should become
      necessary, I can promise you one thing&mdash;you shall have a quicker
      passage into Eternity than they.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it really come to that?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Will nothing but so crude a
      proceeding as my absolute removal satisfy you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else is, I fear, practicable,&rdquo; Bernadine replied, &ldquo;unless you
      decide to listen to reason. Believe me, my dear friend, I shall miss you
      and our small encounters exceedingly, but, unfortunately, you stand in the
      way of my career. You are the only man who has persistently balked me. You
      have driven me to use against you means which I had grown to look upon as
      absolutely extinct in the upper circles of our profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost peered through the glass walls of the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight men, not counting yourself,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;and my poor manager and
      his faithful clerk lying bound and helpless. It is heavy odds, Bernadine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no question of odds, I think,&rdquo; Bernadine answered smoothly. &ldquo;You
      are much too clever a person to refuse to admit that you are entirely in
      my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as regards terms? I really don&rsquo;t feel in the least anxious to make my
      final bow with so little notice,&rdquo; De Grost said. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I
      have been finding life quite interesting lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine eyed his prisoner keenly. Such absolute composure was in itself
      disturbing. He was, for the moment, aware of a slight sensation of
      uneasiness, which his common sense, however, speedily disposed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two ways,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;of dealing with an opponent. There is
      the old-fashioned one&mdash;crude, but in a sense eminently satisfactory&mdash;which
      sends him finally to adorn some other sphere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that one,&rdquo; De Grost interrupted. &ldquo;Get on with the
      alternative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The alternative,&rdquo; Bernadine declared, &ldquo;is when his capacity for harm can
      be destroyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That needs a little explanation,&rdquo; De Grost murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. For instance, if you were to become absolutely discredited, I
      think that you would be effectually out of my way. Your people do not
      forgive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then discredit me, by all means,&rdquo; De Grost begged. &ldquo;It sounds unpleasant,
      but I do not like your callous reference to the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine gazed at his ancient opponent for several moments. After all,
      what was this but the splendid bravado of a beaten man, who is too clever
      not to recognize defeat?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall require,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your code, the keys of your safe, which
      contains a great many documents of interest to me, and a free entry into
      your house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost drew a bunch of keys reluctantly from his pocket and laid them
      upon the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find the code bound in green morocco leather,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;on
      the left-hand side, underneath the duplicate of a proposed Treaty between
      Italy and some other Power. Between ourselves, Bernadine, I really expect
      that that is what you are after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine&rsquo;s eyes glistened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the safe conduct into your house?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Grost drew his case from his pocket and wrote few lines on the back of
      one of his cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will insure you entrance there,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and access to my study.
      If you see my wife, please reassure her as to my absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall certainly do so,&rdquo; Bernadine agreed, with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I may be pardoned for alluding to a purely personal matter,&rdquo; De Grost
      continued, &ldquo;what is to become of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be bound and gagged in the same manner as your manager and his
      clerk,&rdquo; Bernadine replied, smoothly. &ldquo;I regret the necessity, but you see,
      I can afford to run no risks. At four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, you will be
      released. It must be part of our agreement that you allow the man who
      stays behind the others for the purpose of setting you free, to depart
      unmolested. I think I know you better than to imagine you would be guilty
      of such gaucherie as an appeal to the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, unfortunately,&rdquo; De Grost declared, with a little sigh, &ldquo;is, as you
      well know, out of the question. You are too clever for me, Bernadine.
      After all, I shall have to go back to my farm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine opened the door and called softly to one of his men. In less
      than five minutes De Grost was bound hand and foot. Bernadine stepped back
      and eyed his adversary with an air of ill-disguised triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust, Baron,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you will be as comfortable as possible,
      under the circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Grost lay quite still. He was powerless to move or speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately,&rdquo; Bernadine continued, &ldquo;I have presented myself at your
      house, verified your safe conduct, and helped myself to certain papers
      which I am exceedingly anxious to obtain,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I shall telephone
      here to the man whom I leave in charge and you will be set at liberty in
      due course. If, for any reason, I meet with treachery and I do not
      telephone, you will join Mr. Greening and his young companion in a little&mdash;shall
      we call it aquatic recreation? I wish you a pleasant hour and success in
      the future, Baron&mdash;as a farmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine withdrew and whispered his orders to his men. Soon the electric
      light was turned out and the place was in darkness. The front door was
      opened and closed; the group of confederates upon the pavement lit
      cigarettes and wished one another good night with the brisk air of tired
      employees, released at last from long labors. Then there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was barely eleven when Bernadine reached the west end of London. His
      clothes had become a trifle disarranged and he called for a few minutes at
      his rooms in St. James&rsquo;s Street. Afterwards, he walked to Porchester House
      and rang the bell. To the servant who answered it, he handed his master&rsquo;s
      card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you show me the way to the library?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I have some papers
      to collect for the Baron de Grost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated. Even with the card in his hand, it seemed a somewhat
      unusual proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you step inside, sir?&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I should like to show this to the
      Baroness. The master is exceedingly particular about any one entering his
      study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what you like so long as you do not keep me waiting,&rdquo; Bernadine
      replied. &ldquo;Your master&rsquo;s instructions are clear enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Violet came down the great staircase a few moments later, still in her
      dinner gown, her face a little pale, her eyes luminous. Bernadine smiled
      as he accepted her eagerly offered hand. She was evidently anxious. A
      thrill of triumph warmed his blood. Once she had been less kind to him
      than she seemed now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband gave you this!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few minutes ago,&rdquo; Bernadine answered. &ldquo;He tried to make his
      instructions as clear as possible. We are jointly interested in a small
      matter which needs immediate action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led the way to the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems strange,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;that you and he should be working
      together. I always thought that you were on opposite sides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a matter of chance,&rdquo; Bernadine told her. &ldquo;Your husband is a wise
      man, Baroness. He knows when to listen to reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw open the door of the study, which was in darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If you will wait a moment,&rdquo; she said, closing the door, &ldquo;I will turn on
      the electric light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She touched the knobs in the wall and the room was suddenly flooded with
      illumination. At the further end of the apartment was the great safe.
      Close to it, in an easy chair, his evening coat changed for a smoking
      jacket, with a neatly tied black tie replacing his crumpled white cravat,
      the Baron de Grost sat awaiting his guest. A fierce oath broke from
      Bernadine&rsquo;s lips. He turned toward the door only in time to hear the key
      turn. Violet tossed it lightly in the air across to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Bernadine,&rdquo; the latter remarked, &ldquo;on the whole, I do not think
      that this has been one of your successes. My keys, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine stood for a moment, his face dark with passion. He bit his lip
      till the blood came, and the veins at the back of his clenched hands were
      swollen and thick. Nevertheless, when he spoke he had recovered in great
      measure his self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your keys are here, Baron de Grost,&rdquo; he said, placing them upon the
      table. &ldquo;If a bungling amateur may make such a request of a professor, may
      I inquire how you escaped from your bonds, passed through the door of a
      locked warehouse and reached here before me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron de Grost smiled as he pushed the cigarettes across to his
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have only to think for yourself for a moment, my
      dear Bernadine, and you will understand. In the first place, the letter
      you sent me signed &lsquo;Greening&rsquo; was clearly a forgery. There was no one else
      anxious to get me into their power, hence I associated it at once with
      you. Naturally, I telephoned to the chief of my staff&mdash;I, too, am
      obliged to employ some of these un-uniformed policemen, my dear Bernadine,
      as you may be aware. It may interest you to know, further, that there are
      seven entrances to the warehouse in Tooley Street. Through one of these
      something like twenty of my men passed and were already concealed in the
      place when I entered. At another of the doors a motor-car waited for me.
      If I had chosen to lift my finger at any time, your men would have been
      overpowered and I might have had the pleasure of dictating terms to you in
      my own office. Such a course did not appeal to me. You and I, as you know,
      dear Count von Hern, conduct our peculiar business under very delicate
      conditions, and the least thing we either of us desire is notoriety. I
      managed things, as I thought, for the best. The moment you left the place
      my men swarmed in. We kindly, but gently, ejected your guard, released
      Greening and my clerk, and I passed you myself in Fleet Street, a little
      more comfortable, I think, in my forty-horsepower motor-car than you in
      that very disreputable hansom. As to my presence here, I have an entrance
      from the street there which makes me independent of my servants. The other
      details are too absurdly simple; one need not enlarge upon them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine turned slowly to Violet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You knew when you brought me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;We have telephones in every room in the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your service,&rdquo; Bernadine declared, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Grost laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;need I say that you are free to come or go, to
      take a whiskey and soda with me, or to depart at once, exactly as you feel
      inclined? The door was locked only until you restored to me my keys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the room, fitted the key in the lock and turned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not make war as those others,&rdquo; he remarked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine drew himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not drink with you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will not smoke with you. But some
      day this reckoning shall come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the door. De Grost laid his finger upon the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show Count von Hern out,&rdquo; he directed the astonished servant who appeared
      a moment or two later.

      CHAPTER VI. THE SEVEN SUPPERS OF ANDREA KORUST
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter, Baron de Grost, was enjoying what he had confidently looked forward
      to as an evening&rsquo;s relaxation, pure and simple. He sat in one of the front
      rows of the stalls of the Alhambra, his wife by his side and an excellent
      cigar in his mouth. An hour or so ago he had been in telephonic
      communication with Paris, had spoken with Sogrange himself, and received
      his assurance of a calm in political and criminal affairs amounting almost
      to stagnation. It was out of season, and, though his popularity was as
      great as ever, neither he nor his wife had any social engagements; hence
      this evening at a music hall, which Peter, for his part, was finding
      thoroughly amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was packed&mdash;some said owing to the engagement of Andrea
      Korust and his brother, others to the presence of Mademoiselle Sophie
      Celaire in her wonderful danse des apaches. The violinist that night had a
      great reception. Three times he was called before the curtain; three times
      he was obliged to reiterate his grateful but immutable resolve never to
      yield to the nightly storm which demanded more from a man who has given of
      his best. Slim, with the worn face and hollow eyes of a genius, he stood
      and bowed his thanks, but when he thought the time had arrived, he
      disappeared, and though the house shook for minutes afterwards, nothing
      could persuade him to reappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards came the turn which, notwithstanding the furore caused by
      Andrea Korust&rsquo;s appearance, was generally considered to be equally
      responsible for the packed house&mdash;the apache dance of Mademoiselle
      Sophie Celaire. Peter sat slightly forward in his chair as the curtain
      went up. For a time he seemed utterly absorbed by the performance. Violet
      glanced at him once or twice curiously. It began to occur to her that it
      was not so much the dance as the dancer in whom her husband was
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen her before&mdash;this Mademoiselle Celaire?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Peter, nodding, &ldquo;I have seen her before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dance proceeded. It was like many others of its sort, only a little
      more daring, a little more finished. Mademoiselle Celaire, in her
      tight-fitting, shabby black frock, with her wild mass of hair, her
      flashing eyes, her seductive gestures, was, without doubt, a marvelous
      person. Peter, Baron de Grost, watched her every movement with absorbed
      attention. When the curtain went down he forgot to clap. His eyes followed
      her off the stage. Violet shrugged her shoulders. She was looking very
      handsome herself in a black velvet dinner gown, and a hat so exceedingly
      Parisian that no one had had the heart to ask her to remove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Peter,&rdquo; she remarked, reprovingly, &ldquo;a moderate amount of
      admiration for that very agile young lady I might, perhaps, be inclined to
      tolerate; but, having watched you for the last quarter of an hour, I am
      bound to confess that I am becoming jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Mademoiselle Celaire?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Mademoiselle Sophie Celaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned a little towards her. His lips were parted; he was about to make
      a statement or a confession. Just then a tall commissionaire leaned over
      from behind and touched him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Monsieur le Baron de Grost,&rdquo; he announced, handing Peter a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter glanced towards his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You permit me?&rdquo; he murmured, breaking the seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violet shrugged her shoulders, ever so slightly. Her husband was already
      absorbed in the few lines hastily scrawled across the sheet of notepaper
      which he held in his hand.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    MONSIEUR LE BARON DE GHOST.
                    Dear Monsieur le Baron,
             4  Come to my dressing-room, without  4
                fail, as soon as you receive this.
                              SOPHIE CELAIRE.
</pre>
    <p>
      Violet looked over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hussy!&rdquo; she exclaimed, indignantly. Her husband raised his eyebrows.
      With his forefinger he merely tapped the two numerals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Double-Four!&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked around and nodded. The commissionaire was waiting. Peter took up
      his silk hat from under the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am detained, dear,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll make the best of it, won&rsquo;t
      you? The car will be here and Frederick will be looking out for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she answered, cheerfully. &ldquo;I shall be quite all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded brightly and Peter took his departure. He passed through a door
      on which was painted &ldquo;Private,&rdquo; and through a maze of scenery and stage
      hands and ballet ladies by a devious route to the region of the
      dressing-rooms. His guide conducted him to the door of one of these and
      knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entrez, monsieur,&rdquo; a shrill feminine voice replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter entered and closed the door behind him. The commissionaire remained
      outside. Mademoiselle Celaire turned to greet her visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a few words I desire with you as quickly as possible, if you
      please, Monsieur le Baron,&rdquo; she said, advancing towards him. &ldquo;Listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had brushed out her hair and it hung from her head straight and a
      little stiff, almost like the hair of an Indian woman. She had washed her
      face, too, free of all cosmetics and her pallor was almost waxen. She wore
      a dressing gown of green silk. Her discarded black frock lay upon the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am entirely at your service, mademoiselle,&rdquo; Peter answered, bowing.
      &ldquo;Continue, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sup with me to-night&mdash;you are my guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much honored,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;It is an affair of urgency, then?
      Mademoiselle will remember that I am not alone here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw out her hands scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told me in Paris that you were a genius!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Cannot you
      feel, then, when a thing is urgent? Do you not know it without being told?
      You must meet me with a carriage at the stage door in forty minutes. We
      sup in Hamilton Place with Andrea Korust and his brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom?&rdquo; Peter asked, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the Korust Brothers,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I have just been talking to
      Andrea. He calls himself a Hungarian. Bah! They are as much Hungarian,
      those young men, as I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter leaned slightly against the table and looked thoughtfully at his
      companion. He was trying to remember whether he had ever heard anything of
      these young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the prospect of partaking of any meal in your
      company is in itself enchanting, but I do not know your friends, the
      Korust Brothers. Apart from their wonderful music, I do not recollect ever
      having heard of them before in my life. What excuse have I, then, for
      accepting their hospitality? Pardon me, too, if I add that you have not as
      yet spoken as to the urgency of this affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned from him impatiently and, throwing herself back into the chair
      from which she had risen at his entrance, she began to exchange the thick
      woolen stockings which she had been wearing upon the stage for others of
      fine silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, la, la!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You are very slow, Monsieur le Baron. It is,
      perhaps, my stage name which has misled you. I am Marie Lapouse. Does that
      convey anything to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal,&rdquo; Peter admitted, quickly. &ldquo;You stand very high upon the
      list of my agents whom I may trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then stay here no longer,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;for my maid waits outside and I
      need her services. Go back and make your excuses to your wife. In forty
      minutes I shall expect you at the stage door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An affair of diplomacy, this, or brute force?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows what may happen!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I do
      not know myself. Be prepared for anything, but, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, go now!
      I can dress no further without my maid, and Andrea Korust may come in at
      any moment. I do not wish him to find you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter made his way thoughtfully back to his seat. He explained the
      situation to his wife so far as he could, and sent her home. Then he
      waited about until the car returned, smoking a cigarette and trying once
      more to remember if he had ever heard anything from Sogrange of Andrea
      Korust or his brother. Punctually at the time stated he was outside the
      stage door of the music-hall, and a few minutes later Mademoiselle Celaire
      appeared, a dazzling vision of fur and smiles and jewelry imperfectly
      concealed. A small crowd pressed around to see the famous Frenchwoman.
      Peter handed her gravely across the pavement into his waiting car. One or
      two of the loungers gave vent to a groan of envy at the sight of the
      diamonds which blazed from her neck and bosom. Peter smiled as he gave the
      address to his servant and took his place by the side of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They see only the externals, this mob,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;They picture to
      themselves, perhaps, a little supper for two. Alas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Celaire laughed at him softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not trouble to assume that most disconsolate of expressions, my
      dear Baron,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;Your reputation as a man of gallantry is
      beyond question; but remember that I know you also for the most devoted
      and loyal of husbands. We waste no time in folly, you and I. It is the
      business of the Double-Four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was relieved, but his innate politeness forbade his showing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Brothers Korust,&rdquo; she went on, leaning towards him, &ldquo;have a week&rsquo;s
      engagement at the Alhambra. Their salary is six hundred pounds. They play
      very beautifully, of course, but I think that it is as much as they are
      worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter agreed with her fervently. He had no soul for music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have taken the furnished house belonging to one of your dukes, in
      Hamilton Place, for which we are now bound; taken it, too, at a fabulous
      rent,&rdquo; Mademoiselle Celaire continued. &ldquo;They, have installed there a chef
      and a whole retinue of servants. They are here for seven nights; they have
      issued invitations for seven supper parties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hospitable young men they seem to be,&rdquo; Peter murmured. &ldquo;I read in one of
      the stage papers that Andrea is a Count in his own country, and that they
      perform in public only for the love of their music and for the sake of the
      excitement and travel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A paragraph wholly inspired and utterly false,&rdquo; Mademoiselle Celaire
      declared, firmly, sitting a little forward in the car, and laying her
      hand, ablaze with jewels, upon his coat sleeve. &ldquo;Listen. They call
      themselves Hungarians. Bah! I know that they are in touch with a great
      European court, both of them, the court of the country to which they
      belong. They have plans, plans and schemes connected with their visit
      here, which I do not understand. I have done my best with Andrea Korust,
      but he is not a man to be trusted. I know that there is something more in
      these seven supper parties than idle hospitality. I and others like me,
      artistes and musicians, are invited, to give the assembly a properly
      Bohemian tone; but there are to be other guests, attracted there, no
      doubt, because the papers have spoken of these gatherings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some idea of what it all means, in your mind?&rdquo; Peter suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too vague to put into words,&rdquo; she declared, shaking her head. &ldquo;We
      must both watch. Afterwards, we will, if you like, compare notes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The car drew up before the doors of a handsome house in Hamilton Place. A
      footman received Peter and relieved him of his hat and overcoat. A trim
      maid performed the same office for Mademoiselle Celaire. They met, a
      moment or two later, and were ushered into a large drawing-room in which a
      dozen or two of men and women were already assembled, and from which came
      a pleasant murmur of voices and laughter. The apartment was hung with pale
      green satin; the furniture was mostly Chippendale, upholstered in the same
      shade. A magnificent grand piano stood open in a smaller room, just
      visible beyond. Only one thing seemed strange to the two newly arrived
      guests. The room was entirely lit with shaded candles, giving a certain
      mysterious but not unpleasant air of obscurity to the whole suite of
      apartments. Through the gloom, the jewels and eyes of the women seemed to
      shine with a new brilliance. Slight eccentricities of toilette, for a part
      of the gathering was distinctly Bohemian, were softened and subdued. The
      whole effect was somewhat weird, but also picturesque.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrea Korust advanced from a little group to meet his guests. Off the
      stage he seemed at first sight frailer and slighter than ever. His dress
      coat had been exchanged for a velvet dinner jacket, and his white tie for
      a drooping black bow. He had a habit of blinking nearly all the time, as
      though his large brown eyes, which he seldom wholly opened, were weaker
      than they appeared to be. Nevertheless, when he came to within a few paces
      of his newly arrived visitors, they shone with plenty of expression.
      Without any change of countenance, however, he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Andrea,&rdquo; Mademoiselle Celaire exclaimed, &ldquo;you permit me that I
      present to you my dear friend, well known in Paris&mdash;alas! many years
      ago&mdash;Monsieur le Baron de Grost. Monsieur le Baron was kind enough to
      pay his respects to me this evening, and I have induced him to become my
      escort here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my good fortune,&rdquo; Peter remarked, smiling, &ldquo;that I saw
      Mademoiselle Celaire&rsquo;s name upon the bills this evening&mdash;my good
      fortune, since it has procured for me the honor of an acquaintance with a
      musician so distinguished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, Monsieur le Baron,&rdquo; Korust replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stay here, I regret to hear, a very short time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; Andrea Korust admitted, &ldquo;it is so. For myself I would that it were
      longer. I find your London so attractive, the people so friendly. They
      fall in with my whims so charmingly. I have a hatred, you know, of
      solitude. I like to make acquaintances wherever I go, to have delightful
      women and interesting men around, to forget that life is not always gay.
      If I am too much alone, I am miserable, and when I am miserable I am in a
      very bad way indeed. I cannot then make music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled gravely and sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your brother? Does he, too, share your gregarious instincts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Korust paused for a moment before replying. His eyes were quite wide open
      now. If one could judge from his expression, one would certainly have said
      that the Baron de Grost&rsquo;s attempts to ingratiate himself with his host
      were distinctly unsuccessful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother has exactly opposite instincts,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;He finds no
      pleasure in society. At the sound of a woman&rsquo;s voice, he hides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not here, then?&rdquo; Peter asked, glancing around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrea Korust shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is doubtful whether he joins us this evening at all,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;My
      sister, however, is wholly of my disposition. Monsieur le Baron will
      permit that I present him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter bowed low before a very handsome young woman with flashing black
      eyes, and a type of features undoubtedly belonging to one of the countries
      of eastern Europe. She was picturesquely dressed in a gown of flaming red
      silk, made as though in one piece, without trimming or flounces, and she
      seemed inclined to bestow upon her new acquaintance all the attention that
      he might desire. She took him at once into a corner and seated herself by
      his side. It was impossible for Peter not to associate the empressement of
      her manner with the few words which Andrea Korust had whispered into her
      ear at the moment of their introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;are the wonderful Baron de Grost. I have heard of
      you so often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Peter repeated, with twinkling eyes. &ldquo;I have never been
      called that before. I feel that I have no claims whatever to distinction,
      especially in a gathering like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders and glanced carelessly across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are well enough,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;but one wearies of genius on every
      side of one. Genius is not the best thing in the world to live with, you
      know. It has whims and fancies. For instance, look at these rooms&mdash;the
      gloom, the obscurity&mdash;and I love so much the light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the privilege of genius,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;to have whims and to
      indulge in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do Andrea justice,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is, perhaps, scarcely a whim that he
      chooses to receive his guests in semi-darkness. He has weak eyes and he is
      much too vain to wear spectacles. Tell me, you know every one here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; Peter declared. &ldquo;Please enlighten me, if you think it necessary.
      For myself,&rdquo; he added, dropping his voice a little, &ldquo;I feel that the
      happiness of my evening is assured, without making any further
      acquaintances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you came as the guest of Mademoiselle Celaire,&rdquo; she reminded him,
      doubtfully, with a faint regretful sigh and a provocative gleam in her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Mademoiselle Celaire to-night for the first time for years,&rdquo; Peter
      replied. &ldquo;I called to see her in her dressing-room and she claimed me for
      an escort this evening. I am, alas! a very occasional wanderer in the
      pleasant paths of Bohemia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is really true,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I suppose I must tell you
      something about the people, or you will feel that you have wasted your
      opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; Peter whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand and laughed into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;I shall do my duty. Opposite you is Mademoiselle
      Trezani, the famous singer at Covent Garden. Do I need to tell you that, I
      wonder? Rudolf Maesterling, the dramatist, stands behind her there in the
      corner. He is talking to the wonderful Cleo, whom all the world knows.
      Monsieur Guyer there, he is manager, I believe, of the Alhambra; and
      talking to him is Marborg, the great pianist. One of the ladies talking to
      my brother is Esther Braithwaite, whom, of course, you know by sight; she
      is leading lady, is she not, at the Hilarity? The other is Miss Ransome;
      they tell me that she is your only really great English actress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all most interesting,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Now tell me, please, who is
      the military person with the stiff figure and sallow complexion, standing
      by the door? He seems quite alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl made a little grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I ought to be looking after him,&rdquo; she admitted, rising
      reluctantly to her feet. &ldquo;He is a soldier just back from India&mdash;a
      General Noseworthy, with all sorts of letters after his name. If
      Mademoiselle Celaire is generous, perhaps we may have a few minutes&rsquo; 
      conversation later on,&rdquo; she added, with a parting smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, rather, if Mademoiselle Korust is kind,&rdquo; De Grost replied, bowing.
      &ldquo;It depends upon that only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strolled across the room and rejoined Mademoiselle Celaire a few
      moments later. They stood apart in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like my supper,&rdquo; Peter declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wait for one more guest,&rdquo; Mademoiselle Celaire announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more guest! Do you know who it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No idea,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;One would imagine that it was some one of
      importance. Are you any wiser than when you came, dear master?&rdquo; she added,
      under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a whit,&rdquo; he replied, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took out her fan and waved it slowly in front of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you must discover what it all means to-night or not at all,&rdquo; she
      whispered. &ldquo;The dear Andrea has intimated to me most delicately that
      another escort would be more acceptable if I should honor him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That helps,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;See, our last guest arrives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tall,&mdash;spare-looking man was just being announced. They heard his
      name as Andrea presented him to a companion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Mayson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Celaire saw a gleam in her companion&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is coming&mdash;the idea?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very vaguely,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this Colonel Mayson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our only military aeronaut,&rdquo; Peter replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aeronaut!&rdquo; she repeated, doubtfully. &ldquo;I see nothing in that. Both my own
      country and Germany are years ahead of poor England in the air. Is it not
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled and held out his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;supper has been announced. Afterwards, Andrea Korust will
      play to us, and I think that Colonel Mayson and his distinguished brother
      officer from India will talk. We shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed into a room whose existence had suddenly been revealed by the
      drawing back of some beautiful brocaded curtains. Supper was a delightful
      meal, charmingly served. Peter, putting everything else out of his head
      for the moment, thoroughly enjoyed himself, and, remembering his duty as a
      guest, contributed in no small degree towards the success of the
      entertainment. He sat between Mademoiselle Celaire and his hostess, both
      of whom demanded much from him in the way of attention. But he still found
      time to tell stories which were listened to by every one, and exchanged
      sallies with the gayest. Only Andrea Korust, from his place at the head of
      the table, glanced occasionally towards his popular guest with a curious,
      half-hidden expression of distaste and suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more the Baron de Grost shone, the more uneasy he became. The signal
      to rise from the meal was given almost abruptly. Mademoiselle Korust hung
      on to Peter&rsquo;s arm. Her own wishes and her brother&rsquo;s orders seemed
      absolutely to coincide. She led him towards a retiring corner of the music
      room. On the way, however, Peter overheard the introduction which he had
      expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Noseworthy is just returned from India, Colonel Mayson,&rdquo; Korust
      said, in his usual quiet, tired tone. &ldquo;You will, perhaps, find it
      interesting to talk together a little. As for me, I play because all are
      polite enough to wish it, but conversation disturbs me not in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter passed, smiling, on to the corner pointed out by his companion,
      which was the darkest and most secluded in the room. He took her fan and
      gloves, lit her cigarette, and leaned back by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does your brother, a stranger to London, find time to make the
      acquaintance of so many interesting people?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He brought many letters,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;He has friends everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; Peter remarked, &ldquo;that an acquaintance of my own, the
      Count von Hern, spoke to me once about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took her cigarette from her lips and turned her head slightly. Peter&rsquo;s
      expression was one of amiable reminiscence. His cheeks were a trifle
      flushed, his appearance was entirely reassuring. She laughed at her
      brother&rsquo;s caution. She found her companion delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the Count von Hern is a friend of my brother&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she admitted,
      carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of yours?&rdquo; he whispered, his arm slightly pressed against hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed at him silently and their eyes met. Decidedly Peter, Baron de
      Grost, found it hard to break away from his old weakness! Andrea Korust,
      from his place near the piano, breathed a sigh of relief as he watched. A
      moment or two later, however, Mademoiselle Korust was obliged to leave her
      companion to receive a late but unimportant guest, and almost
      simultaneously Colonel Mayson passed by on his way to the farther end of
      the apartment. Andrea Korust was bending over the piano to give some
      instructions to his accompanist. Peter leaned forward and his face and
      tone were strangely altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find General Noseworthy of the Indian Army a little inquisitive,
      Colonel,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter turned sharply round. There was meaning in those few words,
      without doubt! There was meaning, too, in the still, cold face which
      seemed to repel his question. He passed on thoughtfully. Mademoiselle
      Korust, with a gesture of relief, came back and threw herself once more
      upon the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must talk in whispers,&rdquo; she said, gayly. &ldquo;Andrea always declares that
      he does not mind conversation, but too much noise is, of course,
      impossible. Besides, Mademoiselle Celaire will not spare you to me for
      long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a whole language,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;which was made for whispers. And
      as for Mademoiselle Celaire&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Celaire is, I think, more your brother&rsquo;s friend than mine,&rdquo;
       he murmured. &ldquo;At least, I will be generous. He has given me a delightful
      evening. I resign my claims upon Mademoiselle Celaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would break your heart,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice sank even below a whisper. Decidedly, Peter, Baron de Grost, did
      not improve!
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose to leave precisely at the right time, neither too early nor too
      late. He had spent altogether a most amusing evening. There were one or
      two little comedies which had diverted him extremely. At the moment of
      parting, the beautiful eyes of Mademoiselle Korust had been raised to his
      very earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come again very soon&mdash;to-morrow night?&rdquo; she had whispered.
      &ldquo;Is it necessary that you bring Mademoiselle Celaire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is altogether unnecessary,&rdquo; Peter replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me try and entertain you instead, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was precisely at that instant that Andrea had sent for his sister.
      Peter watched their brief conversation with much interest and intense
      amusement. She was being told not to invite him there again and she was
      rebelling! Without a doubt, he had made a conquest! She returned to him
      flushed and with a dangerous glitter in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Baron,&rdquo; she said, leading him on one side, &ldquo;I am ashamed and
      angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother is annoyed because you have asked me here to-morrow night?&rdquo;
       he asked, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;Indeed, I thank you that you have spared me
      the task of putting my brother&rsquo;s discourtesy into words. Andrea takes
      violent fancies like that sometimes. I am ashamed, but what can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he admitted, with a sigh. &ldquo;I obey, of course. Did
      your brother mention the source of his aversion to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is too absurd sometimes,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;One must treat him like a
      great baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, there must be a reason,&rdquo; Peter persisted, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has heard some foolish thing from Count von Hern,&rdquo; she admitted,
      reluctantly. &ldquo;Do not let us think anything more about it. In a few days it
      will have passed. And meanwhile&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused. He leaned a little towards her. She was looking intently at a
      ring upon her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would really like to see me,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;and if you are sure
      that Mademoiselle Celaire would not object, could you not ask me to tea
      to-morrow&mdash;or the next day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; Peter insisted, with a becoming show of eagerness. &ldquo;Shall we
      say at the Canton at five?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather a public place?&rdquo; she objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere else you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment. She seemed to be waiting for some suggestion
      from him. None came, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Carlton at five,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I am angry with Andrea. I feel,
      even, that I could break his wonderful violin in two!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter sighed once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to twist von Hern&rsquo;s neck,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Lucky for him that
      he&rsquo;s in St. Petersburg! Let us forget this unpleasant matter,
      mademoiselle. The evening has been too delightful for such memories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Celaire turned to her escort eagerly as soon as they were
      alone together in the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As an escort, let me tell you, my dear Baron,&rdquo; she exclaimed, with some
      pique, &ldquo;that you are a miserable failure! For the rest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the rest, I will admit that I am puzzled,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;I need to
      think. I have the glimmerings of an idea&mdash;no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will act? It is an affair for us&mdash;for the Double-Four?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt&mdash;an affair and a serious one,&rdquo; Peter assured her. &ldquo;I
      shall act; exactly how I cannot say until after to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; she repeated, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Korust takes tea with me,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quiet sort of way, the series of supper parties given by Andrea
      Korust became the talk of London. The most famous dancer in the world
      broke through her unvarying rule and night after night thrilled the
      distinguished little gathering. An opera singer, the &ldquo;star&rdquo; of the season,
      sang, a great genius recited, and Andrea himself gave always of his best.
      Apart from this wonderful outpouring of talent, Andrea Korust himself
      seemed to possess the peculiar art of bringing into touch with one another
      people naturally interested in the same subjects. On the night after the
      visit of Peter, Baron de Grost, His Grace the Duke of Rosshire was
      present, the man in whose hands lay the destinies of the British Navy;
      and, curiously enough, on the same night, a great French writer on naval
      subjects was present, whom the Duke had never met, and with whom he was
      delighted to talk for some time apart. On another occasion, the Military
      Secretary to the French Embassy was able to have a long and instructive
      chat with a distinguished English general on the subject of the recent
      maneuvers, and the latter received, in the strictest confidence, some very
      interesting information concerning the new type of French guns. On the
      following evening, the greatest of our Colonial statesmen, a red-hot
      Imperialist, was able to chat about the resources of the Empire with an
      English politician of similar views whom he chanced never to have
      previously met. Altogether, these parties seemed to be the means of
      bringing together a series of most interesting people, interesting not
      only in themselves, but in their relations to one another. It was
      noticeable, however, that from this side of his little gatherings Andrea
      Korust remained wholly apart. He frankly admitted that music and cheerful
      companionship were the only two things in life he cared for. Politics or
      matters of world import seemed to leave him unmoved. If a serious subject
      of conversation were started at supper time, he was frankly bored, and
      took no particular pains to hide the fact. It is certain that whatever
      interesting topics were alluded to in his presence, he remained entirely
      outside any understanding of them. Mademoiselle Celaire, who was present
      most evenings, although with other escorts, was entirely puzzled. She
      could see nothing whatever to account for the warning which she had
      received, and which she had passed on, as was her duty, to the Baron de
      Grost. She failed, also, to understand the faint but perceptible
      enlightenment to which Peter himself had admittedly attained after that
      first evening. Take that important conversation, for instance, between the
      French military attach, and the English general. Without a doubt it was of
      interest, and especially so to the country which she was sure claimed his
      allegiance, but it was equally without doubt that Andrea Korust neither
      overheard a word of that conversation nor betrayed the slightest curiosity
      concerning it. Mademoiselle Celaire was a clever woman and she had never
      felt so hopelessly at fault....
    </p>
    <p>
      The seventh and last of these famous supper parties was in full swing.
      Notwithstanding the shaded candles, which left the faces of the guests a
      little indistinct, the scene was a brilliant one. Mademoiselle Celaire was
      wearing her famous diamonds, which shone through the gloom like pin-pricks
      of fire. Garda Desmaines, the wonderful Garda, sat next to her host, her
      bosom and hair on fire with jewels, yet with the most wonderful light of
      all glowing in her eyes. A famous actor, who had thrown his proverbial
      reticence to the winds, kept his immediate neighbors in a state of
      semi-hysterical mirth. The clink of wine glasses, the laughter of
      beautiful women, the murmur of cultivated voices, rising and swelling
      through the faint, mysterious gloom, made a picturesque, a wonderful
      scene. Pale as a marble statue, with the covert smile of the gracious
      host, Andrea Korust sat at the head of his table, well pleased with his
      company, as indeed he had the right to be. By his side was a great
      American statesman, who was traveling around the world and yet had refused
      all other invitations of this sort. He had come for the pleasure of
      meeting the famous Dutch writer and politician, Mr. Van Jool. The two were
      already talking intimately. It was at this point that tragedy, or
      something like it, intervened. A impatient voice was heard in the hall
      outside, a voice which grew louder and louder, more impatient, finally
      more passionate. People raised their heads to listen. The American
      statesman, who was, perhaps, the only one to realize exactly what was
      coming, slipped his hand into his pocket and gripped something cold and
      hard. Then the door was flung open. An apologetic and much disturbed
      butler made the announcement which had evidently been demanded of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Von Tassen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed&mdash;breathless&mdash;the silence before the bursting
      of the storm. Mr. Von Tassen was the name of the American statesman, and
      the man who rose slowly from his place by his host&rsquo;s side was the exact
      double of the man who stood now upon the threshold, gazing in upon the
      room. The expression of the two alone was different. The newcomer was
      furiously angry, and looked it. The sham Mr. Von Tassen was very much at
      his ease. It was he who broke the silence, and his voice was curiously
      free from all trace of emotion. He was looking his double over with an air
      of professional interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the whole,&rdquo; he said, calmly, &ldquo;very good. A little stouter, I perceive,
      and the eyebrows a trifle too regular. Of course, when you make faces at
      me like that, it is hard to judge of the expression. I can only say that I
      did the best I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the devil are you, masquerading in my name?&rdquo; the newcomer demanded,
      with emphasis. &ldquo;This man is an impostor!&rdquo; he added, turning to Andrea
      Korust. &ldquo;What is he doing at your table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrea leaned forward and his face was an evil thing to look upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he hissed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sham Mr. Von Tassen turned away for a moment and stooped down. The
      trick has been done often enough upon the stage, often in less time, but
      seldom with more effect. The wonderful wig disappeared, the spectacles,
      the lines in the face, the make-up of diabolical cleverness. With his back
      to the wall and his fingers playing with something in his pocket, Peter,
      Baron de Grost, smiled upon his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you insist upon knowing&mdash;the Baron de Grost, at your service!&rdquo;
       he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrea Korust was, for the moment, speechless. One of the women shrieked.
      The real Mr. Von Tassen looked around him helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will some one be good enough to enlighten me as to the meaning of this?&rdquo;
       he begged. &ldquo;Is it a roast? If so, I only want to catch on. Let me get to
      the joke, if there is one. If not, I should like a few words of
      explanation from you, sir,&rdquo; he added, addressing Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; the latter replied. &ldquo;In the meantime, let me persuade you
      that I am not the only impostor here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized a glass of water and dashed it in the face of Mr. Van Jool.
      There was a moment&rsquo;s scuffle, and no more of Mr. Van Jool. What emerged
      was a good deal like the shy Maurice Korust, who accompanied his brother
      at the music hall, but whose distaste for these gatherings had been
      Andrea&rsquo;s continual lament. The Baron de Grost stepped back once more
      against the wall. His host was certainly looking dangerous. Mademoiselle
      Celaire was leaning forward, staring through the gloom with distended
      eyes. Around the table every head was turned towards the centre of the
      disturbance. It was Peter again who spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me suggest, Andrea Korust,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you send your guests&mdash;those
      who are not immediately interested in this affair&mdash;into the next
      room. I will offer Mr. Von Tassen then the explanation to which he is
      entitled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrea Korust staggered to his feet. The nerve had failed. He was shaking
      all over. He pointed to the music room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would be so good, ladies and gentlemen?&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;We will
      follow you immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went with obvious reluctance. All their eyes seemed focussed upon
      Peter. He bore their scrutiny with calm cheerfulness. For a moment he had
      feared Korust, but that moment had passed. A servant, obeying his master&rsquo;s
      gesture, pulled back the curtains after the departing crowd. The four men
      were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Von Tassen,&rdquo; Peter said, easily, &ldquo;you are a man who loves adventures.
      To-night you experience a new sort of one. Over in your great country,
      such methods are laughed at as the cheap device of sensation mongers.
      Nevertheless, they exist. To-night is a proof that they exist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get on to facts, sir,&rdquo; the American admonished. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to explain to
      me what you mean by passing yourself off as Thomas Von Tassen, before you
      leave this room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With much pleasure, Mr. Von Tassen,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;For your information,
      I might tell you that you are not the only person in whose guise I have
      figured. In fact, I have had quite a busy week. I have been&mdash;let me
      see&mdash;I have been Monsieur le Marquis de Beau Kunel on the night when
      our shy friend, Maurice Korust, was playing the part of General Henderson.
      I have also been His Grace the Duke of Rosshire when my friend Maurice
      here was introduced to me as Francois Defayal, known by name to me as one
      of the greatest writers on naval matters. A little awkward about the
      figure I found His Grace, but otherwise I think that I should have passed
      muster wherever he was known. I have also passed as Sir William Laureston,
      on the evening when my rival artist here sang the praises of Imperial
      England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrea Korust leaned forward with venomous eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that it was you who was here last night in Sir William
      Laureston&rsquo;s place?&rdquo; he almost shrieked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; Peter admitted, &ldquo;but you must remember that, after all,
      my performances have been no more difficult than those of your shy but
      accomplished brother. Whenever I took to myself a strange personality I
      found him there, equally good as to detail, and with his subject always at
      his finger tips. We settled that little matter of the canal, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
       Peter remarked, cheerfully, laying his hand upon the shoulder of the young
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stared at him, those two white-faced brothers, like tiger-cats about
      to spring. Mr. Von Tassen was getting impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;you may be clearing matters up so far as
      regards Mr. Andrea Korust and his brother, but I&rsquo;m as much in the fog as
      ever. Where do I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, sir,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;I am getting nearer things now. These
      two young men&mdash;we will not call them hard names&mdash;are suffering
      from an excess of patriotic zeal. They didn&rsquo;t come and sit down on a camp
      stool and sketch obsolete forts, as those others of their countrymen do
      when they want to pose as the bland and really exceedingly ignorant
      foreigner. They went about the matter with some skill. It occurred to them
      that it might be interesting to their country to know what Sir William
      Laureston thought about the strength of the Imperial Navy, and to what
      extent his country was willing to go in maintaining their allegiance to
      Great Britain. Then there was the Duke of Rosshire. They thought they&rsquo;d
      like to know his views as to the development of the Navy during the next
      ten years. There was that little matter, too, of the French guns. It would
      certainly be interesting to them to know what Monsieur le Marquis de Beau
      Kunel had to say about them. These people were all invited to sit at the
      hospitable board of our host here. I, however, had an inkling on the first
      night of what was going on, and I was easily able to persuade those in
      authority to let me play their several parts. You, sir,&rdquo; Peter added,
      turning to Mr. Von Tassen, &ldquo;you, sir, floored me. You were not an
      Englishman, and there was no appeal which I could make. I simply had to
      risk you. I counted upon your not turning up. Unfortunately, you did.
      Fortunately, you are the last guest. This is the seventh supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Von Tassen glanced around at the three men and made up his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you call yourself?&rdquo; he asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baron de Grost,&rdquo; Peter replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my friend the Baron de Grost,&rdquo; Von Tassen said, &ldquo;I think that you
      and I had better get out of this. So I was to talk about Germany with Mr.
      Van Jool, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already explained your views,&rdquo; Peter declared, with twinkling
      eyes. &ldquo;Mr. Van Jool was delighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Von Tassen shook with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;this is a great story! If you&rsquo;re ready, Baron de
      Grost, lead the way to where we can get a whiskey and soda and a chat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Celaire came gliding out to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to be left here,&rdquo; she whispered, taking Peter&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked back from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, Mr. Andrea Korust,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your first supper was a
      success. Colonel Mayson was genuine. Our real English military aeronaut
      was here, and he has disclosed to you, Maurice Korust, all that he ever
      knew. Henceforth, I presume your great country will dispute with us for
      the mastery of the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer country, this!&rdquo; Mr. Von Tassen remarked, pausing on the step to
      light a cigar. &ldquo;Seems kind of humdrum after New York, but there&rsquo;s no use
      talking. Things do happen over here, anyway!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII. MAJOR KOSUTH&rsquo;S MISSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      His host, very fussy as he always was on the morning of his big shoot,
      came bustling towards Peter, Baron de Grost, with a piece of paper in his
      hand. The party of men had just descended from a large brake and were
      standing about on the edge of the common, examining cartridges, smoking a
      last cigarette before the business of the morning, and chatting together
      over the prospects of the day&rsquo;s sport. In the distance, a cloud of dust
      indicated the approach of a fast traveling motor-car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Baron,&rdquo; Sir William Bounderby said, &ldquo;I want you to change your
      stand to-day. I must have a good man at the far corner as the birds go off
      my hand from there, and Addington was missing them shockingly yesterday.
      Besides, there is a new man coming on your left and I know nothing of his
      shooting&mdash;nothing at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere you choose to put me, Sir William,&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;They came
      badly for Addington yesterday, and well for me. However, I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish people wouldn&rsquo;t bring strangers, especially to the one shoot where
      I&rsquo;m keen about the bag. I told Portal he could bring his brother-in-law,
      and he&rsquo;s bringing this foreign fellow instead. Don&rsquo;t suppose he can shoot
      for nuts! Did you ever hear of him, I wonder? The Count von Hern, he calls
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The motor-car had come to a standstill by this time. From it descended Mr.
      Portal himself, a large neighboring land owner, a man of culture and
      travel. With him was Bernadine, in a very correct shooting suit and
      Tyrolese hat. On the other side of Mr. Portal was a short, thick set man,
      with olive complexion, keen black eyes, black mustache and imperial, who
      was dressed in city clothes. Sir William&rsquo;s eyebrows were slightly raised
      as he advanced to greet the party. Peter was at once profoundly
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Portal introduced his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will forgive me, I am sure, for bringing a spectator, Bounderby,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Major Kosuth, whom I have the honor to present&mdash;Major Kosuth,
      Sir William Bounderby&mdash;is high up in the diplomatic service of a
      country with whom we must feel every sympathy&mdash;the young Turks. The
      Count von Hern, who takes my brother-in-law&rsquo;s place, is probably known to
      you by name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir William welcomed his visitors cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not shoot, Major Kosuth?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very seldom,&rdquo; the Turk answered. &ldquo;I come to-day with my good friend,
      Count von Hern, as a spectator, if you permit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; Sir William replied. &ldquo;We will find you a safe place near your
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little party began to move toward the wood. It was just at this moment
      that Bernadine felt a touch upon his shoulder, and, turning around, found
      Peter by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An unexpected pleasure, my dear Count,&rdquo; the latter declared, suavely. &ldquo;I
      had no idea that you took interest in such simple sports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The manners of Count von Hern were universally quoted as being almost too
      perfect. It is a regrettable fact, however, that at that moment he swore&mdash;softly,
      perhaps, but with distinct vehemence. A moment later he was exchanging the
      most cordial of greetings with his old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the knack, my dear De Grost,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;of turning up in the
      most surprising places. I certainly did not know that among your many
      accomplishments was included a love for field sports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled quietly. He was a very fine shot, and knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must amuse oneself these days,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is little else to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My absence from this country, I fear, has robbed you of an occupation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has certainly deprived life of some of its savor,&rdquo; Peter admitted,
      blandly. &ldquo;By the bye, will you not present me to your friend? I have the
      utmost sympathy with the intrepid political party of which he is a
      member.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Hern performed the introduction with a reluctance which he wholly
      failed to conceal. The Turk, however, had been walking on his other side,
      and his hat was already lifted. Peter had purposely raised his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gives me the greatest pleasure, Major Kosuth,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;to welcome
      you to this country. In common, I believe, with the majority of my country
      people, I have the utmost respect and admiration for the movement which
      you represent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Major Kosuth smiled slowly. His features were heavy and unexpressive.
      There was something of gloom, however, in the manner of his response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, Baron,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and I welcome very much this
      expression of your interest in my party. I believe that the hearts of your
      country people are turned towards us in the same manner. I could wish that
      your country&rsquo;s political sympathies were as easily aroused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine intervened promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Kosuth has been here only one day,&rdquo; he remarked, lightly. &ldquo;I tell
      him that he is a little too impatient. See, we are approaching the wood.
      It is as well here to refrain from conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will resume it later,&rdquo; Peter said, softly. &ldquo;I have interests in
      Turkey, and it would give me great pleasure to have a talk with Major
      Kosuth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Financial interests?&rdquo; the latter inquired, with some eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will explain after the first drive,&rdquo; he said, turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter walked rather quickly until he reached a bend in the wood, and
      overtaking his host, paused for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lend me a loader for half an hour, Sir William,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I have to
      send my servant to the village with a telegram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure!&rdquo; Sir William answered. &ldquo;There are several to spare. I&rsquo;ll
      send one to your stand. There&rsquo;s Von Hern going the wrong way!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, in a tone of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was just in time to stop the whistle from going to his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do me another favor, Sir William,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Give me time to send off
      my telegram before the Count sees what I&rsquo;m doing. He&rsquo;s such an inquisitive
      person,&rdquo; he went on, noticing his host&rsquo;s look of blank surprise. &ldquo;Thank
      you ever so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter hurried on to his place. It was round the corner of the wood and for
      the moment out of sight of the rest of the party. He tore a sheet from his
      pocket-book and scribbled out a telegram. His man had disappeared and a
      substitute taken his place by the time von Hern arrived. The latter was
      now all amiability. It was hard to believe, from his smiling salutation,
      that he and the man to whom he waved his hand in so airy a fashion had
      ever declared war to the death!
    </p>
    <p>
      The shooting began a few minutes later. Major Kosuth, from a campstool a
      few yards behind his friend, watched with somewhat languid interest. He
      gave one, indeed, the impression that his thoughts were far removed from
      this simple country party, the main object of whose existence for the
      present seemed to be the slaying of a certain number of inoffensive birds.
      He watched the indifferent performance of his friend and the remarkably
      fine shooting of his neighbor on the left, with the same lack-luster eye
      and want of enthusiasm. The beat was scarcely over before Peter, resigning
      his smoking guns, lit a cigarette and strolled across to the next stand.
      He plunged at once into a conversation with Kosuth, notwithstanding
      Bernadine&rsquo;s ill-concealed annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Kosuth,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I sympathize with you. It is a hard task for a
      man whose mind is centered upon great events, to sit still and watch a
      performance of this sort. Be kind to us all and remember that this
      represents to us merely a few hours of relaxation. We, too, have our more
      serious moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You read my thoughts well,&rdquo; Major Kosuth declared. &ldquo;I do not seek to
      excuse them. For half a life-time we Turks have toiled and striven, always
      in danger of our lives, to help forward those things which have now come
      to pass. I think that our lives have become tinged with somberness and
      apprehension. Now that the first step is achieved, we go forward, still
      with trepidation. We need friends, Baron de Grost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot seriously doubt but that you will find them in this country,&rdquo;
       Peter remarked. &ldquo;There has never been a time when the English nation has
      not sympathized with the cause of liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the hearts of your people,&rdquo; Major Kosuth said, &ldquo;which I fear.
      It is the antics of your politicians. Sympathy is a great thing, and good
      to have, but Turkey to-day needs more. The heart of a nation is big, but
      the number of those in whose hands it remains to give practical expression
      to its promptings, is few.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine, who had stood as much as he could, seized forcibly upon his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must remember our bargain, Kosuth,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;no politics to-day.
      Until to-morrow evening we rest. Now I want to introduce you to a very old
      friend of mine&mdash;the Lord-Lieutenant of the county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No man was better informed in current political affairs, but Peter,
      instead of joining the cheerful afternoon tea party at the close of the
      day, raked out a file of the Times from the library, and studied it
      carefully in his room. There were one or two items of news concerning
      which he made pencil notes. He had scarcely finished his task before a
      servant brought in a dispatch. He opened it with interest and drew pencil
      and paper towards him. It was from Paris, and in the code which he had
      learned by heart, no written key of which existed. Carefully he transposed
      it on to paper and read it through. It was dated from Paris a few hours
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kosuth left for England yesterday. Envoy from new Turkish Government.
      Requiring loan one million pounds. Asked for guarantee that it was not for
      warlike movement against Bulgaria, declined to give same. Communicated
      with English Ambassador and informed Kosuth yesterday that neither
      government would sanction loan unless undertaking were given that the same
      was not to be applied for war against Bulgaria. Turkey is under covenant
      to enter into no financial obligations with any other Power while the
      interest of former loans remains in abeyance. Kosuth has made two efforts
      to obtain loan privately, from prominent English financier and French
      Syndicate. Both have declined to treat on representations from government.
      Kosuth was expected return direct to Turkey. If, as you say, he is in
      England with Bernadine, we commend the affair to your utmost vigilance.
      Germany exceedingly anxious enter into close relations with new government
      of Turkey. Fear Kosuth&rsquo;s association with Bernadine proof of bad faith.
      Have had interview with Minister for foreign affairs, who relies upon our
      help. French Secret Service at your disposal, if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter read the message three times with the greatest care. He was on the
      point of destroying it when Violet came into the room. She was wearing a
      long tea jacket of sheeny silk. Her beautiful hair was most becomingly
      arranged, her figure as light and girlish as ever. She came into the room
      humming gayly and swinging a gold purse upon her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won three rubbers out of four, Peter,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;and a compliment
      from the Duchess. Am I a pupil to be proud of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short. Her lips formed themselves into the shape of a whistle.
      She knew very well the signs. Her husband&rsquo;s eyes were kindling, there was
      a firm set about his lips, the palm of his hand lay flat upon that sheet
      of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was true?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;It was Bernadine who was shooting to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was on the next stand,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is something doing, of course,&rdquo; Violet continued. &ldquo;My dear
      Peter, you may be an enigma to other people. To me you have the most
      expressive countenance I ever saw. You have had a cable which you have
      just transcribed. If I had been a few minutes later, I think you would
      have torn up the result. As it is, I think I have come just in time to
      hear all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled, grimly but fondly. He uncovered the sheet of paper and
      placed it in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t much to tell you. Von Hern turned up this
      morning with a Major Kosuth, who was one of the leaders of the revolution
      in Turkey. I wired Paris and this is the reply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read the message through thoughtfully and handed it back. Peter lit a
      match, and standing over the fireplace calmly destroyed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A million pounds is not a great sum of money,&rdquo; Violet remarked. &ldquo;Why
      could not Kosuth borrow it for his country from a private individual?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A million pounds is not a large sum to talk about,&rdquo; Peter replied, &ldquo;but
      it is an exceedingly large sum for any one, even a multi-millionaire, to
      handle in cash. And Turkey, I gather, wants it at once. Besides,
      considerations which might be a security from a government, are no
      security at all as applied to a private individual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that Kosuth means to go behind the existing treaty and
      borrow from Germany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quite believe that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It would mean the straining of
      diplomatic relations with both countries. It is out of the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then where does Bernadine come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; Peter answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violet laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that you are going to try and find out?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying to discover who it is that Bernadine and Kosuth are waiting
      to see,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;The worst of it is, I daren&rsquo;t leave here. I shall
      have to trust to the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go and dress,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve a little of your blood in
      me, after all. Life seems more stirring when Bernadine is on the scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shooting party broke up two days later and Peter and his wife returned
      at once to town. The former found the reports which were awaiting his
      arrival disappointing. Bernadine and his guest were not in London, or if
      they were they had carefully avoided all the usual haunts. Peter read his
      reports over again, smoked a very long cigar alone in his study, and
      finally drove down to the city and called upon his stockbroker, who was
      also a personal friend. Things were flat in the city, and the latter was
      glad enough to welcome an important client. He began talking the usual
      market shop until his visitor stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to you, Edwardes, more for information than anything,&rdquo; Peter
      declared, &ldquo;although it may mean that I shall need to sell a lot of stock.
      Can you tell me of any private financier who could raise a loan of a
      million pounds in cash within the course of a week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stockbroker looked dubious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In cash,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Money isn&rsquo;t raised that way, you know. I doubt
      whether there are many men in the whole city of London who could put up
      such an amount with only a week&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there must be some one,&rdquo; Peter persisted. &ldquo;Think! It would probably
      be a firm or a man not obtrusively English. I don&rsquo;t think the Jews would
      touch it, and a German citizen would be impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Semi-political, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather that way,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would your friend Count von Hern be likely to be concerned in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Peter asked, with immovable face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, only I saw him coming out of Heseltine-Wrigge&rsquo;s office the other
      day,&rdquo; the stockbroker remarked, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very wealthy American financier,&rdquo; the stockbroker replied, &ldquo;not at all
      an unlikely person for a loan of the sort you mention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;American citizen?&rdquo; Peter inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt. Of German descent, I should say, but nothing much left
      of it in his appearance. He settled over here in a huff because New York
      society wouldn&rsquo;t receive his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember all about it,&rdquo; Peter declared. &ldquo;She was a chorus girl, wasn&rsquo;t
      she? Nothing particular against her, but the fellow had no tact. Do you
      know him, Edwardes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slightly,&rdquo; the stockbroker answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a letter to him,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;Give my credit as good a leg as
      you can. I shall probably go as a borrower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Edwardes wrote a few lines and handed them to his client.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Office is nearly opposite,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Wish you luck, whatever your
      scheme is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter crossed the street and entered the building which his friend had
      pointed out. He ascended in the lift to the third floor, knocked at the
      door which bore Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge&rsquo;s name, and almost ran into the arms
      of a charmingly dressed little lady, who was being shown out by a
      broad-shouldered, typical American. Peter hastened to apologize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, raising his hat. &ldquo;I was rather in a hurry
      and I quite thought I heard some one say &lsquo;Come in.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady replied pleasantly. Her companion, who was carrying his hat in
      his hand, paused reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you want to see me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge, I did,&rdquo; Peter admitted. &ldquo;I am the Baron
      de Grost, and I have a letter of introduction to you from Mr. Edwardes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge tore open the envelope and glanced through the
      contents of the note. Peter, meanwhile, looked at his wife with genuine
      but respectfully cloaked admiration. The lady obviously returned his
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if you&rsquo;re the Baron de Grost,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you marry Vi
      Brown? She used to be at the Gaiety with me, years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly did marry Violet Brown,&rdquo; Peter confessed, &ldquo;and, if you will
      allow me to say so, Mrs. Heseltine-Wrigge, I should have recognized you
      anywhere from your photographs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, isn&rsquo;t that queer?&rdquo; the little lady remarked, turning to her husband.
      &ldquo;I should love to see Vi again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will give me your address,&rdquo; Peter declared, promptly, &ldquo;my wife
      will be delighted to call upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man looked up from the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to talk business with me, Baron?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a few moments only,&rdquo; Peter answered. &ldquo;I am afraid I am a great
      nuisance, and if you wish it I will come down to the city again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge replied. &ldquo;Myra won&rsquo;t mind waiting
      a minute or two. Come through here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and led the way into a quiet-looking suite of offices, where one
      or two clerks were engaged writing at open desks. They all three passed
      into an inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any objections to my wife coming in?&rdquo; Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge asked.
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s scarcely any place for her out there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; Peter answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember we have to meet the Count von Hern at half past one at Prince&rsquo;s,
      Charles,&rdquo; she reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband nodded. There was nothing in Peter&rsquo;s expression to denote that
      he had already achieved the first object of his visit!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not detain you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your name has been mentioned to me,
      Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge, as a financier likely to have a large sum of money
      at his disposal. I have a scheme which needs money. Providing the security
      is unexceptionable, are you in a position to do a deal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo; Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A million to a million and a half,&rdquo; Peter answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dollars?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge&rsquo;s pose to appear surprised. Nevertheless,
      his eyebrows were slightly raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, what is this scheme?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; Peter replied, &ldquo;I should like to know whether there&rsquo;s any
      chance of business if I disclose it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not an atom,&rdquo; Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge declared. &ldquo;I have just committed
      myself to the biggest financial transaction of my life and it will clean
      me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t waste your time,&rdquo; Peter announced, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down for a moment,&rdquo; Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge invited, biting the end off
      a cigar and passing the box toward Peter. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. My wife
      doesn&rsquo;t mind. Say, it strikes me as rather a curious thing that you should
      come in here and talk about a million and a half, when that&rsquo;s just the
      amount concerned in my other little deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact, it isn&rsquo;t at all queer,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
      the money. I came to see whether you were really interested in the other
      affair&mdash;the Turkish loan, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge withdrew his cigar from his mouth and looked steadily
      at his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Baron,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got a nerve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here as much in your interests as my
      own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom do you represent, anyway?&rdquo; Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A company you have never heard of,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;Our offices are in
      the underground places of the world, and we don&rsquo;t run to brass plates. I
      am here because I am curious about that loan. Turkey hasn&rsquo;t a shadow of
      security to offer you. Everything which she can pledge is pledged, to
      guarantee the interest on existing loans to France and England. She is
      prevented by treaty from borrowing in Germany. If you make a loan without
      security, Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge, I suppose you understand your position.
      The loan may be repudiated at any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of a philanthropist, aren&rsquo;t you, Baron?&rdquo; Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge
      remarked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; Peter assured him. &ldquo;I know there is some tricky work
      going on and I haven&rsquo;t brains enough to get to the bottom of it. That&rsquo;s
      why I&rsquo;ve come blundering in to you, and why I suppose you&rsquo;ll be telling
      the whole story to the Count von Hern at luncheon in an hour&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge smoked in silence for a moment or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This transaction of mine,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t one I can talk about.
      I guess I&rsquo;m on to what you want to know, but I simply can&rsquo;t tell you. The
      security is unusual, but it&rsquo;s good enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems so to you, beyond a doubt,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;Still, you have to
      do with a remarkably clever young man in the Count von Hern. I don&rsquo;t want
      to ask you any questions you feel I ought not to, but I do wish you&rsquo;d tell
      me one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go right ahead,&rdquo; Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge invited. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be shy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What day are you concluding this affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge scratched his chin for a moment thoughtfully and
      glanced at his diary. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll risk that,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;A week to-day I
      hand over the coin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter drew a little breath of relief. A week was an immense time! He rose
      to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ends our business, then, for the present,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now I am going
      to ask both of you a favor. Perhaps I have no right to, but as a man of
      honor, Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge, you can take it from me that I ask it in your
      interests as well as my own. Don&rsquo;t tell the Count von Hern of my visit to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You hear, Myra?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be dumb, Baron,&rdquo; she promised. &ldquo;Say, when do you think Vi can come
      and see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was guilty of snobbery. He considered it quite a justifiable weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is at Windsor this afternoon,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, at the Garden-Party?&rdquo; Mrs. Heseltine-Wrigge almost shrieked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe there&rsquo;s some fete or other to-morrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re
      alone this evening. Why won&rsquo;t you dine with us, say at the Carlton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to,&rdquo; the lady assented, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Peter said, taking his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner party was a great success. Mrs. Heseltine-Wrigge found herself
      among the class of people with whom it was her earnest desire to become
      acquainted, and her husband was well satisfied to see her keen longing for
      society likely to be gratified. The subject of Peter&rsquo;s call at the office
      in the city was studiously ignored. It was not until the very end of the
      evening, indeed, that the host of this very agreeable party was rewarded
      by a single hint. It all came about in the most natural manner. They were
      speaking of foreign capitals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love Paris,&rdquo; Mrs. Heseltine-Wrigge told her host. &ldquo;Just adore it.
      Charles is often there on business and I always go along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled. There was just a chance here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband does not often have to leave London though,&rdquo; he remarked,
      carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not often enough,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I just love getting about. Last week we
      had a perfectly horrible trip, though. We started off for Belfast quite
      unexpectedly, and I hated every minute of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled inwardly, but he said never a word. His companion was already
      chattering on about something else. Peter crossed the hall a few minutes
      later, to speak to an acquaintance, slipped out to the telephone booth and
      spoke to his servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bag and a change,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;at Euston Station at twelve o&rsquo;clock, in
      time for the Irish mail. Your mistress will be home as usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later the dinner party broke up. Early the next morning, Peter
      crossed the Irish Channel. He returned the following day and crossed again
      within a few hours. In five days the affair was finished, except for the
      denouement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter ascended in the lift to Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge&rsquo;s office the following
      Thursday, calm and unruffled as usual, but nevertheless a little exultant.
      It was barely half an hour since he had become finally prepared for this
      interview. He was looking forward to it now with feelings of undiluted
      satisfaction. Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge was in, he was told, and he was at once
      admitted to his presence. The financier greeted him with a somewhat
      curious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, this is very nice of you to look me up again!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Still
      worrying about that loan, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not worrying about that any more,&rdquo; he answered, accepting one of
      his host&rsquo;s cigars. &ldquo;The fact of it is that if it were not for me, you
      would be the one who would have to do the worrying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge stopped short in the act of lighting his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite on,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no trouble, fortunately,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;Only a little
      disappointment for our friends the Count von Hern and Major Kosuth. I have
      brought you some information which I think will put an end to that affair
      of the loan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge sat quite still for a moment. He brows were knitted,
      he showed no signs of nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go right on,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The security upon which you were going to advance a million and a half to
      the Turkish Government,&rdquo; Peter continued, &ldquo;consisted of two Dreadnoughts
      and a cruiser, being built to the order of that country by Messrs.
      Shepherd &amp; Hargreaves at Belfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge admitted, quietly. &ldquo;I have been up and
      seen the boats. I have seen the shipbuilders, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you happen to mention to the latter,&rdquo; Peter inquired, &ldquo;that you were
      advancing money upon those vessels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge replied. &ldquo;Kosuth wouldn&rsquo;t hear of
      such a thing. If the papers got wind of it, there&rsquo;d be the devil to pay.
      All the same, I have got an assignment from the Turkish Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not worth the paper it&rsquo;s written on,&rdquo; Peter declared, blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge rose unsteadily to his feet. He was a strong, silent
      man, but there was a queer look about his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do you mean?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Briefly, this,&rdquo; Peter explained. &ldquo;The first payment, when these ships
      were laid down, was made not by Turkey but by an emissary of the German
      Government, who arranged the whole affair in Constantinople. The second
      payment was due ten months ago, and not a penny has been paid. Notice was
      given to the late government twice and absolutely ignored. According to
      the charter, therefore, these ships reverted to the shipbuilding companies
      who retained possession of the first payment as indemnity against loss.
      The Count von Hern&rsquo;s position was this. He represents the German
      Government. You were to find a million and a half of money with the ships
      as security. You also have a contract from the Count von Hern to take
      those ships off your hands provided the interest on the loan became
      overdue, a state of affairs which I can assure you would have happened
      within the next twelve months. Practically, therefore, you were made use
      of as an independent financier to provide the money with which the Turkish
      Government, broadly speaking, have sold the ships to Germany. You see,
      according to the charter of the shipbuilding company, these vessels cannot
      be sold to any foreign government without the consent of Downing Street.
      That is the reason why the affair had to be conducted in such a roundabout
      manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is beyond me,&rdquo; Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge said, hoarsely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      care a d-n who has the ships in the end so long as I get my money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would not get your money,&rdquo; Peter pointed out, &ldquo;because there will
      be no ships. I have had the shrewdest lawyers in the world at work upon
      the charter, and there is not the slightest doubt that these vessels are,
      or rather were, the entire property of Messrs. Shepherd &amp; Hargreaves.
      To-day they belong to me. I have bought them and paid two hundred thousand
      pounds deposit. I can show you the receipt and all the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge, said only one word, but that word was profane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, of course, that you have lost the business,&rdquo; Peter concluded,
      &ldquo;but surely it&rsquo;s better than losing your money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge struck the table fiercely with his fist. There was a
      gray and unfamiliar look about his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-n it, the money&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; he declared, hoarsely. &ldquo;They changed the day.
      Kosuth had to go back. I paid it twenty-four hours ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter whistled softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only you had trusted me a little more!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I tried to warn
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge snatched up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t leave till the two-twenty,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll catch them at
      the Milan. If we don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m ruined! By God, I&rsquo;m ruined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They found Major Kosuth in the hall of the hotel. He was wearing a fur
      coat and was otherwise attired for traveling. His luggage was already
      being piled upon a cab. Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge wasted no words upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and I have got to have a talk, right here and now,&rdquo; he declared.
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Count?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Major Kosuth frowned gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; he said, shortly. &ldquo;Our business is concluded
      and I am leaving by the two-twenty train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are doing nothing of the sort,&rdquo; the American answered, standing
      before him, grim and threatening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Turk showed no sign of terror. He gripped his silver-headed cane
      firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there is no one here who will prevent me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter, who saw a fracas imminent, hastily intervened. &ldquo;If you will permit
      me for a moment,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is a little explanation I should perhaps
      make to Major Kosuth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Turk took a step towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no time to listen to explanations from you or any one,&rdquo; he
      replied. &ldquo;My cab is waiting. I depart. If Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge is not
      satisfied with our transaction, I am sorry, but it is too late to alter
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment it seemed as though a struggle between the two men was
      inevitable. Already people were glancing at them curiously, for Mr.
      Heseltine-Wrigge came of a primitive school, and he had no intention
      whatever of letting his man escape. Fortunately, at that moment Count von
      Hern came up and Peter at once appealed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;may I beg for your good offices? My friend, Mr.
      Heseltine-Wrigge here, is determined to have a few words with Major Kosuth
      before he leaves. Surely this is not an unreasonable request when you
      consider the magnitude of the transaction which has taken place between
      them! Let me beg of you to persuade Major Kosuth to give us ten minutes.
      There is plenty of time for the train, and this is not the place for a
      brawl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not take us long, Kosuth, to hear what our friend has to say,&rdquo; he
      remarked. &ldquo;We shall be quite quiet in the smoking-room. Let us go in there
      and dispose of the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Turk turned unwillingly in the direction indicated. All four men
      passed through the cafe, up some stairs, and into the small smoking-room.
      The room was deserted. Peter led the way to the far corner, and standing
      with his elbow leaning upon the mantelpiece, addressed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The position is this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge has parted with a
      million and a half of his own money, a loan to the Turkish Government, on
      security which is not worth a snap of the fingers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a lie!&rdquo; Major Kosuth exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Baron, you are woefully misinformed,&rdquo; the Count declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not misinformed. My friend here has parted with the
      money on the security of two battleships and a cruiser, now building in
      Shepherd &amp; Hargreaves&rsquo; yard at Belfast. The two battleships and
      cruiser in question belong to me. I have paid two hundred thousand pounds
      on account of them, and hold the shipbuilder&rsquo;s receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad!&rdquo; Bernadine cried, contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head and continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The battleships were laid down for the Turkish Government, and the money
      with which to start them was supplied by the Secret Service of Germany.
      The second installment was due ten months ago and has not been paid. The
      time of grace provided for has expired. The shipbuilders, in accordance
      with their charter, were consequently at liberty to dispose of the vessels
      as they thought fit. On the statement of the whole of the facts to the
      head of the firm, he has parted with these ships to me. I need not say
      that I have a purchaser within a mile from here. It is a fancy of mine,
      Count von Hern, that those ships will sail better under the British flag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s tense silence. The face of the Turk was black with
      anger. Bernadine was trembling with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a tissue of lies!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The facts are easy enough for you to prove,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I have here,&rdquo;
       he added, producing a roll of papers, &ldquo;copies of the various documents for
      your inspection. Your scheme, of course, was simple enough. It fell
      through for this one reason only. A final notice, pressing for the second
      installment and stating the days of grace, was forwarded to Constantinople
      about the time of the recent political troubles. The late government
      ignored it. In fairness to Major Kosuth, we will believe that the present
      government was ignorant of it. But the fact remains that Messrs. Shepherd
      &amp; Hargreaves became at liberty to sell those vessels, and that I have
      bought them. You will have to give up that money, Major Kosuth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, he shall!&rdquo; the American muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine leaned a little towards his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must give us a minute or two,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;We shall not go away, I
      promise you. Within five minutes you shall hear our decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter sat down at the writing-table and commenced a letter. Mr.
      Heseltine-Wrigge mounted guard over the door and stood there, a grim
      figure of impatience. Before the five minutes was up, Bernadine crossed
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you, Baron,&rdquo; he said, dryly. &ldquo;You are either an
      exceedingly lucky person or you are more of a genius than I believe.
      Kosuth is even now returning his letters of credit to your friend. You are
      quite right. The loan cannot stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure,&rdquo; Peter answered, &ldquo;that you would see the matter correctly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and I,&rdquo; Bernadine continued, &ldquo;know very well that I don&rsquo;t care a fig
      about Turkey, new or old. The ships I will admit that I intended to have
      for my own country. As it is, I wish you joy of them. Before they are
      completed, we may be fighting in the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled, and, side by side with Bernadine, strolled across to
      Heseltine-Wrigge, who was buttoning up a pocket-book with trembling
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;I believe that the days of wars are over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may or may not be,&rdquo; Bernadine answered. &ldquo;One thing is very certain.
      Even if the nations remain at peace, there are enmities which strike only
      deeper as the years pass. I am going to take a drink now with my
      disappointed friend Kosuth. If I raise my glass &lsquo;To the Day!&rsquo; you will
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge and I are for the same destination,&rdquo; he
      replied, pushing open the swing door which led to the bar. &ldquo;I return your
      good wishes, Count. I, too, drink &lsquo;To the Day!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine and Kosuth left, a few minutes afterwards. Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge,
      who was feeling himself again, watched them depart with ill-concealed
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, you had those fellows on toast, Baron,&rdquo; he declared, admiringly. &ldquo;I
      couldn&rsquo;t follow the whole affair, but I can see that you&rsquo;re in for big
      things sometimes. Remember this. If money counts at any time, I&rsquo;m with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter clasped his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money always counts,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and friends!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER VIII. THE MAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter, Baron de Grost, glanced at the card which his butler had brought in
      to him, carelessly at first, afterwards with that curious rigidity of
      attention which usually denotes the setting free of a flood of memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman would like to see you, sir,&rdquo; the man announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can show him in at once,&rdquo; Peter replied. The servant withdrew. Peter,
      during those few minutes of waiting, stood with his back to the room and
      his face to the window, looking out across the square, in reality seeing
      nothing, completely immersed in this strange flood of memories. John Dory&mdash;Sir
      John Dory now&mdash;his quondam enemy, and he, had met but seldom during
      these years of their prosperity. The figure of this man, who had once
      loomed so largely in his life, had gradually shrunk away into the
      background. Their avoidance of each other arose, perhaps, from a sort of
      instinct which was certainly no matter of ill-will. Still, the fact
      remained that they had scarcely exchanged a word for years, and Peter
      turned to receive his unexpected guest with a curiosity which he did not
      trouble wholly to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John Dory&mdash;Chief Commissioner now of Scotland Yard, a person of
      weight and importance&mdash;had changed a great deal during the last few
      years. His hair had become gray, his walk more dignified. There was the
      briskness, however, of his best days in his carriage and in the flash of
      his brown eyes. He held out his hand to his ancient foe with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Baron,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hope you are going to say that you are glad
      to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; Peter replied, with a good-humored grimace, &ldquo;your visit is
      official, I am more than glad&mdash;I am charmed. Sit down. I was just
      going to take my morning cigar. You will join me? Good! Now I am ready for
      the worst that can happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men seated themselves. John Dory pulled at his cigar
      appreciatively, sniffed its flavor for a moment, and then leaned forward
      in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My visit, Baron,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;is semi-official. I am here to ask you a
      favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An official favor?&rdquo; Peter demanded quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His visitor hesitated as though he found the question hard to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;this call of mine is wholly an
      inspiration. It does not in any way concern you personally, or your
      position in this country. What that may be I do not know, except that I am
      sure it is above any suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; Peter murmured. &ldquo;How diplomatic you have become, my dear
      friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Dory smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am fencing about too much,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know, of course, that
      you are a member of a very powerful and wealthy French Society, whose
      object and aims, so far as I know, are entirely harmless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to be assured that you recognize that fact,&rdquo; Peter
      admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might add,&rdquo; John Dory continued, &ldquo;that this harmlessness&mdash;is of
      recent date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, you do seem to know a good deal,&rdquo; Peter confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find myself still fencing,&rdquo; Dory declared. &ldquo;A matter of habit, I
      suppose. I didn&rsquo;t mean to when I came. I made up my mind to tell you
      simply that Guillot was in London, and to ask you if you could help me to
      get rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked thoughtfully into his companion&rsquo;s face, but he did not speak.
      He understood at such moments the value of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We speak together,&rdquo; Dory continued softly, &ldquo;as men who understand one
      another. Guillot is the one criminal in Europe whom we all fear; not I
      alone, mind you&mdash;it is the same in Berlin, in Petersburg, in Vienna.
      He has never been caught. It is my honest belief that he never will be
      caught. At the same time, wherever he arrives the thunder-clouds gather.
      He leaves behind him always a trail of evil deeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well put,&rdquo; Peter murmured. &ldquo;Quite picturesque.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you help me to get rid of him?&rdquo; Dory inquired. &ldquo;I have my hands full
      just now, as you can imagine, what with the political crisis and these
      constant mass meetings. I want Guillot out of the country. If you can
      manage this for me, I shall be your eternal debtor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you imagine,&rdquo; Peter asked, &ldquo;that I can help you in this matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief silence. John Dory knocked the ash from his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Times have changed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The harmlessness of your great Society, my
      dear Baron, is at present admitted. But there were days&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Peter interrupted. &ldquo;As shrewd as ever, I perceive. Do you know
      anything of the object of his coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything of his plans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know where he is staying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Dory answered. &ldquo;He has taken a second-floor flat in Crayshaw
      Mansions, Shaftesbury Avenue. As usual, he is above all petty artifices.
      He has taken it under the name of Monsieur Guillot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know whether there is anything I can do,&rdquo; Peter decided,
      &ldquo;but I will look into the matter for you, with pleasure. Perhaps I may be
      able to bring a little influence to bear&mdash;indirectly, of course. If
      so, it is at your service. Lady Dory is well, I trust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the best of health,&rdquo; Sir John replied, accepting the hint and rising
      to his feet. &ldquo;I shall hear from you soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt,&rdquo; Peter answered. &ldquo;I must certainly call upon Monsieur
      Guillot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter certainly wasted no time in paying his promised visit. That same
      afternoon he rang the bell at the flat in Crayshaw Mansions. A typical
      French butler showed him into the room where the great man sat. Monsieur
      Guillot, slight, elegant, pre-eminently a dandy, was lounging upon a sofa,
      being manicured by a young lady. He threw down his Petit Journal and rose
      to his feet, however, at his visitor&rsquo;s entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Baron,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;but this is charming of you!
      Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he added, turning to the manicurist, &ldquo;you will do me the
      favor of retiring for a short time. Permit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door and showed her out. Then he came back to Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A visit of courtesy, Monsieur le Baron?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt,&rdquo; Peter replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is beyond all measure charming of you,&rdquo; Guillot declared, &ldquo;but let me
      ask you a little question. Is it peace or war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what you choose to make it,&rdquo; Peter answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man threw out his hands. There was the shadow of a frown upon his pale
      forehead. It was a matter for protest, this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you come?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What have we in common? The Society has
      expelled me. Very well, I go my own way. Why not? I am free of your
      control to-day. You have no more right to interfere with my schemes than I
      with yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have the ancient right of power,&rdquo; Peter said, grimly. &ldquo;You were once a
      prominent member of our organization, the spoilt protege of Madame, a
      splendid maker, if you will, of criminal history. Those days have passed.
      We offered you a pension which you have refused. It is now our turn to
      speak. We require you to leave this city in twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face was livid with anger. He was of the fair type of Frenchman, with
      deep-set eyes, and a straight, cruel mouth only partly concealed by his
      golden mustache. Just now, notwithstanding the veneer of his too perfect
      clothes and civilized air, the beast had leaped out. His face was like the
      face of a snarling animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It is I who refuse! I am here on my own affairs.
      What they may be is no business of yours or of any one else&rsquo;s. That is my
      answer to you, Baron de Grost, whether you come to me for yourself or on
      behalf of the Society to which I no longer belong. That is my answer&mdash;that
      and the door,&rdquo; he added, pressing the bell. &ldquo;If you will, we fight. If you
      are wise, forget this visit as quickly as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter took up his hat. The man-servant was already in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall probably meet again before your return, Monsieur Guillot,&rdquo; he
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guillot had recovered himself. His smile was wicked, but his bow
      perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the fortunate hour, Monsieur le Baron!&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter drove hack to Berkeley Square, and without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation
      pressed the levers which set to work the whole underground machinery of
      the great power which he controlled. Thenceforward, Monsieur Guillot was
      surrounded with a vague army of silent watchers. They passed in and out of
      his fiat, their motor cars were as fast as his in the streets, their fancy
      in restaurants identical with his. Guillot moved through it all like a man
      wholly unconscious of espionage, showing nothing of the murderous anger
      which burned in his blood. The reports came to Peter every hour, although
      there was, indeed, nothing worth chronicling. Monsieur Guillot&rsquo;s visit to
      London would seem, indeed, to be a visit of gallantry. He spent most of
      his time with Mademoiselle Louise, the famous dancer. He was prominent at
      the Empire, to watch her nightly performance, they were a noticeable
      couple supping together at the Milan afterwards. Monsieur Guillot was
      indeed a man of gallantry, but he had the reputation of using these
      affairs to cloak his real purposes. Those who watched him, watched only
      the more closely. Monsieur Guillot, who stood it very well at first,
      unfortunately lost his temper. He drove in the great motor car which he
      had brought with him from Paris, to Berkeley Square, and confronted Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he exclaimed, though indeed the glitter in his eyes knew
      nothing of friendship, &ldquo;it is intolerable, this! Do you think that I do
      not see through these dummy waiters, these obsequious shopmen, these
      ladies who drop their eyes when I pass, these commissionaires, these
      would-be acquaintances? I tell you that they irritate me, this
      incompetent, futile crowd. You pit them against me! Bah! You should know
      better. When I choose to disappear, I shall disappear, and no one will
      follow me. When I strike, I shall strike, and no one will discover what my
      will may be. You are out of date, dear Baron, with your third-rate army of
      stupid spies. You succeed in one thing only&mdash;you succeed in making me
      angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is at least an achievement, that,&rdquo; Peter declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Monsieur Guillot admitted, fiercely. &ldquo;Yet mark now the result.
      I defy you, you and all of them. Look at your clock. It is five minutes to
      seven. It goes well, that clock, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the correct time,&rdquo; Peter said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then by midnight,&rdquo; Guillot continued, shaking his fist in the other&rsquo;s
      face, &ldquo;I shall have done that thing which brought me to England and I
      shall have disappeared. I shall have done it in spite of your watchers, in
      spite of your spies, in spite, even, of you, Monsieur le Baron de Grost.
      There is my challenge. Voila. Take it up if you will. At midnight you
      shall hear me laugh. I have the honor to wish you good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter opened the door with his own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is excellent,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You are now, indeed, the Monsieur
      Guillot of old. Almost you persuade me to take up your challenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guillot laughed derisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;By midnight tonight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The challenge of Monsieur Guillot was issued precisely at four minutes
      before seven. On his departure, Peter spent the next half-hour studying
      certain notes and sending various telephone messages. Afterwards, he
      changed his clothes at the usual time and sat down to a tete-a-tete dinner
      with his wife. Three times during the course of the meal he was summoned
      to the telephone, and from each call he returned more perplexed. Finally,
      when the servants had left the room, he took his chair around to his
      wife&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you were asking me just now about the telephone. You
      were quite right. These were not ordinary messages which I have been
      receiving. I am engaged in a little matter which, I must confess,
      perplexes me. I want your advice, perhaps your help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite ready,&rdquo; she answered, smiling. &ldquo;It is a long time since you
      gave me anything to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard of Guillot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reflected for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the wonderful Frenchman,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;the head of the criminal
      department of the Double-Four?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who was at its head when it existed. The criminal department, as
      you know, has all been done away with. The Double-Four has now no more
      concern with those who break the law, save in those few instances where
      great issues demand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Monsieur Guillot still exists?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He not only exists,&rdquo; answered Peter, &ldquo;but he is here in London, a rebel
      and a defiant one. Do you know who came to see me the other morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir John Dory,&rdquo; Peter continued. &ldquo;He came here with a request. He begged
      for my help. Guillot is here, committed to some enterprise which no one
      can wholly fathom. Dory has enough to do with other things, as you can
      imagine, just now. Besides, I think he recognizes that Monsieur Guillot is
      rather a hard nut for the ordinary English detective to crack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; she demanded, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I join forces with Dory,&rdquo; Peter admitted. &ldquo;Sogrange agrees with me.
      Guillot was associated with the Double-Four too long for us to have him
      make scandalous history either here or in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not only seen him, but declared war against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guillot is defiant,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;He has been here only this evening.
      He mocks at me. He swears that he will bring off this enterprise, whatever
      it may be, before midnight to-night, and he has defied me to stop him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will,&rdquo; she murmured, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled. The conviction in his wife&rsquo;s tone was a subtle compliment
      which he did not fail to appreciate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have hopes,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;and yet, let me tell you this, Violet. I
      have never been more puzzled. Ask yourself, now. What enterprise is there
      worthy of a man like Guillot, in which he could engage himself here in
      London between now and midnight? Any ordinary theft is beneath him. The
      purloining of the crown jewels, perhaps, he might consider, but I don&rsquo;t
      think that anything less in the way of robbery would bring him here. He
      has his code and he is as vain as a peacock. Yet money is at the root of
      everything he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does he spend his time here?&rdquo; Violet asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a handsome flat in Shaftesbury Avenue,&rdquo; Peter answered, &ldquo;where he
      lives, to all appearance, the life of an idle man of fashion. The whole of
      his spare time is spent with Mademoiselle Louise, the danseuse at the
      Empire. You see, it is half-past eight now. I have eleven men altogether
      at work, and according to my last report he was dining with her in the
      grill-room at the Milan. They have just ordered their coffee ten minutes
      ago, and the car is waiting outside to take Mademoiselle to the Empire.
      Guillot&rsquo;s box is engaged there, as usual. If he proposes to occupy it, he
      is leaving himself a very narrow margin of time to carry out any
      enterprise worth speaking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Violet was thoughtful for several moments. Then she crossed the room, took
      up a copy of an illustrated paper, and brought it across to Peter. He
      smiled as he glanced at the picture to which she pointed, and the few
      lines underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has struck you, too, then!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Good! You have answered me
      exactly as I hoped. Somehow, I scarcely trusted myself. I have both cars
      waiting outside. We may need them. You won&rsquo;t mind coming to the Empire
      with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I only hope I may be in at the finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the finish,&rdquo; Peter remarked, &ldquo;is of the nature which I anticipate, I
      shall take particularly good care that you are not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The curtain was rising upon the first act of the ballet as they entered
      the most popular music-hall in London and were shown to the box which
      Peter had engaged. The house was full&mdash;crowded, in fact, almost to
      excess. They had scarcely taken their seats when a roar of applause
      announced the coming of Mademoiselle Louise. She stood for a moment to
      receive her nightly ovation, a slim, beautiful creature, looking out upon
      the great house with that faint, bewitching smile at the corners of her
      lips, which every photographer in Europe had striven to reproduce. Then
      she moved away to the music, an exquisite figure, the personification of
      all that was alluring in her sex. Violet leaned forward to watch her
      movements as she plunged into the first dance. Peter was occupied looking
      around the house. Monsieur Guillot was there, sitting insolently forward
      in his box, sleek and immaculate. He even waved his hand and bowed as he
      met Peter&rsquo;s eye. Somehow or other, his confidence had its effect. Peter
      began to feel vaguely troubled. After all, his plans were built upon a
      surmise. It was so easy for him to be wrong. No man would show his hand so
      openly, unless he were sure of the game. Then his face cleared a little.
      In the box adjoining Guillot&rsquo;s, the figure of a solitary man was just
      visible, a man who had leaned over to applaud Louise, but who was now
      sitting back in the shadows. Peter recognized him at once, notwithstanding
      the obscurity. This was so much to the good, at any rate. He took up his
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a quarter of an hour you will excuse me, Violet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Watch
      Guillot. If he leaves his place, knock at the door of your own box, and
      one of my men, who is outside, will come to you at once. He will know
      where to find me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter hurried away, pausing for a moment in the promenade, to scribble a
      line or two at the back of one of his own cards. Presently he knocked at
      the door of the box adjoining Guillot&rsquo;s and was instantly admitted. Violet
      continued her watch. She remained alone until the curtain fell upon the
      first act of the ballet. A few minutes later, Peter returned. She knew at
      once that things were going well. He sank into a chair by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have messages every five minutes,&rdquo; he whispered in her ear, &ldquo;and I am
      venturing upon a bold stroke. There is still something about the affair,
      though, which I cannot understand. You are absolutely sure that Guillot
      has not moved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Violet pointed with her program across the house. &ldquo;There he sits,&rdquo; she
      remarked. &ldquo;He left his chair as the curtain went down, but he could
      scarcely have gone out of the box, for he was back within ten seconds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked steadily across at the opposite box. Guillot was sitting a
      little further back now, as though he no longer courted observation.
      Something about his attitude puzzled the man who watched him. With a
      sudden quick movement he caught up the glasses which stood by his wife&rsquo;s
      side. The curtain was going up for the second act, and Guillot had turned
      his head. Peter held the glasses only for a moment to his eyes, and then
      glanced down at the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s a genius! Violet, the small motor is
      coming for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was out of the box in a single step. Violet looked after him, looked
      down upon the stage and across at Guillot&rsquo;s box. It was hard to
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain had scarcely rung up upon the second act of the ballet when a
      young lady who met from all the loungers, and even from the doorkeeper
      himself, the most respectful attention, issued from the stage-door at the
      Empire and stepped into the large motor car which was waiting, drawn up
      against the curb. The door was opened from inside and closed at once. She
      held out her hands, as yet ungloved, to the man who sat back in the
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;And I thought, indeed, that you had forsaken
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hands and held them tightly, but he answered only in a
      whisper. He wore a sombre black cloak and a broad-brimmed black hat. A
      muffler concealed the lower part of his face. She put her finger upon the
      electric light, but he stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not be recognized,&rdquo; he said thickly. &ldquo;Forgive me, Louise, if I
      seem strange at first, but there is more in it than I can tell you. No one
      must know that I am in London to-night. When we reach this place to which
      you are taking me, and we are really alone, then we can talk. I have so
      much to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him doubtfully. It was indeed a moment of indecision with
      her. Then she began to laugh softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear one, but you have changed!&rdquo; she exclaimed, compassionately. &ldquo;After
      all, why not? I must not forget that things have gone so hardly with you.
      It seems odd, indeed, to see you sitting there, muffled up like an old
      man, afraid to show yourself. You know how foolish you are? With your
      black cape and that queer hat, you are so different from all the others.
      If you seek to remain unrecognized, why do you not dress as all the men
      do? Any one who was suspicious would recognize you from your clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I did not think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not even kiss me?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a little grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are cold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;They are watching me&mdash;even
      to-night they are watching me. Oh, if you only knew, Louise, how I have
      longed for this hour that is to come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her vanity was assuaged. She patted his hand but came no nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a foolish man,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;very foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not for you to say that,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If I have been foolish, were
      not you often the cause of my folly?&rdquo; Again she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, la, la! It is always the same! It is always you men who accuse! For
      that presently I shall reprove you. But now&mdash;as for now, behold, we
      have arrived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a crowded thoroughfare,&rdquo; the man remarked, nervously, looking up
      and down Shaftesbury Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupid!&rdquo; she cried, stepping out. &ldquo;I do not recognize you to-night,
      little one. Even your voice is different. Follow me quickly across the
      pavement and up the stairs. There is only one flight. The flat I have
      borrowed is on the second floor. I do not care very much that people
      should recognize me either, under the circumstances. There is nothing they
      love so much,&rdquo; she added, with a toss of the head, &ldquo;as finding an excuse
      to have my picture in the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her down the dim hall and up the broad, flat stairs, keeping
      always some distance behind. On the first landing she drew a key from her
      pocket and opened a door. It was the door of Monsieur Guillot&rsquo;s
      sitting-room. A round table in the middle was laid for supper. One light
      alone, and that heavily shaded, was burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, la, la!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How I hate this darkness! Wait till I can
      turn on the lights, dear friend, and then you must embrace me. It is from
      outside, I believe. No, do not follow. I can find the switch for myself.
      Remain where you are. I return instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left him alone in the room, closing the door softly. In the passage
      she reeled for a moment and caught at her side. She was very pale.
      Guillot, coming swiftly up the steps, frowned as he saw her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is there?&rdquo; he demanded, harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is there,&rdquo; Louise replied, &ldquo;but, indeed, I am angry with myself. See,
      I am faint. It is a terrible thing, this, which I have done. He did me no
      harm, that young man, except that he was stupid and heavy, and that I
      never loved him. Who could love him, indeed! But, Guillot&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed on, scarcely heeding her words, but she clung to his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear one,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;promise that you will not really hurt him.
      Promise me that, or I will shriek out and call the people from the streets
      here. You would not make an assassin of me? Promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guillot turned suddenly towards her and there were strange things in his
      face. He pointed down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back, Louise,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;back to your rooms, for your own sake.
      Remember that you have left the theatre too ill to finish your
      performance. You have had plenty of time already to get home. Quick! Leave
      me to deal with this young man. I tell you to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She retreated down the stairs, dumb, her knees shaking with fear. Guillot
      entered the room, closing the door behind him. Even as he bowed to that
      dark figure standing in the corner, his left hand shot forward the bolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; the visitor interrupted, haughtily. &ldquo;I am
      expecting Mademoiselle Louise. I did not understand that strangers had the
      right of entry into this room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guillot bowed low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he said once more, &ldquo;it is a matter for my eternal regret that
      I am forced to intrude even for a moment upon an assignation so romantic.
      But there is a little matter which must first be settled. I have some
      friends here who have a thing to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked softly, with catlike tread, along by the wall to where the thick
      curtains shut out the inner apartment. He caught at the thick velvet,
      dragged it back, and the two rooms were suddenly flooded with light. In
      the recently discovered one, two stalwart-looking men in plain clothes,
      but of very unmistakable appearance, were standing waiting. Guillot
      staggered back. They were strangers to him. He was like a man who looks
      upon a nightmare. His eyes protruded. The words which he tried to utter,
      failed him. Then, with a swift, nervous presentiment, he turned quickly
      around towards the man who had been standing in the shadows. Here, too,
      the unexpected had happened. It was Peter, Baron de Grost, who threw his
      muffler and broad-brimmed hat upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five minutes to eleven, I believe, Monsieur Guillot,&rdquo; Peter declared. &ldquo;I
      win by an hour and five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guillot said nothing for several seconds. After all, though, he had great
      gifts. He recovered alike his power of speech and his composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, pointing with his left hand towards the inner
      room&mdash;&ldquo;I do not understand their presence in my apartments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They represent, I am afraid, the obvious end of things,&rdquo; he explained.
      &ldquo;You have given me a run for my money, I confess. A Monsieur Guillot who
      is remarkably like you, still occupies your box at the Empire, and
      Mademoiselle Jeanne Lemere, the accomplished understudy of the lady who
      has just left us, is sufficiently like the incomparable Louise to escape,
      perhaps, detection for the first few minutes. But you gave the game away a
      little, my dear Guillot, when you allowed your quarry to come and gaze
      even from the shadows of his box at the woman he adored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is&mdash;he?&rdquo; Guillot faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is on his way back to his country home,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;I think that
      he will be cured of his infatuation for Mademoiselle. The assassins whom
      you planted in that room are by this time in Bow Street. The price which
      others beside you knew, my dear Guillot, was placed upon that unfortunate
      young head, will not pass this time into your pocket. For the rest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest is of no consequence,&rdquo; Guillot interrupted, bowing. &ldquo;I admit
      that I am vanquished. As for those gentlemen there,&rdquo; he added, waving his
      hand towards the two men who had taken a step forward, &ldquo;I have a little
      oath which is sacred to me concerning them. I take the liberty, therefore,
      to admit myself defeated, Monsieur le Baron, and to take my leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one was quick enough to interfere. They had only a glimpse of him as he
      stood there with the revolver pressed to his temple, an impression of a
      sharp report, of Guillot staggering back as the revolver slipped from his
      fingers on to the floor. Even his death cry was stifled. They carried him
      away without any fuss, and Peter was just in time, after all, to see the
      finish of the second act of the ballet. The sham Monsieur Guillot still
      smirked at the sham Louise, but the box by his side was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is over?&rdquo; Violet asked, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is over,&rdquo; Peter answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, after all, an unrecorded tragedy. In an obscure corner of the
      morning papers one learned the next day that a Frenchman, who had
      apparently come to the end of his means, had committed suicide in a
      furnished flat of Shaftesbury Avenue. Two foreigners were deported without
      having been brought up for trial, for being suspected persons. A little
      languid interest was aroused at the inquest when one of the witnesses
      deposed to the deceased&rsquo;s having been a famous French criminal. Nothing
      further transpired, however, and the readers of the halfpenny press for
      once were deprived of their sensation. For the rest, Peter received, with
      much satisfaction, a remarkably handsome signet ring, bearing some famous
      arms, and a telegram from Sogrange: &ldquo;Well done, Baron! May the successful
      termination of your enterprise nerve you for the greater undertaking which
      is close at hand. I leave for London by the night train. Sogrange.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IX. THE GHOSTS OF HAVANA HARBOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may now,&rdquo; Sogrange remarked, buttoning up his ulster, and stretching
      himself out to the full extent of his steamer chair, &ldquo;consider ourselves
      at sea. I trust, my friend, that you are feeling quite comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter, lying at his ease upon a neighboring chair, with a pillow behind
      his head, a huge fur coat around his body, and a rug over his feet, had
      all the appearance of being very comfortable indeed. His reply, however,
      was a little short&mdash;almost peevish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am comfortable enough for the present, thank you. Heaven knows how long
      it will last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange waved his arms towards the great uneasy plain of blue sea, the
      showers of foam leaping into the sunlight, away beyond the disappearing
      coast of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;For eight days, I hope. Consider, my dear Baron!
      What could be more refreshing, more stimulating to our jaded nerves than
      this? Think of the December fogs you have left behind, the cold, driving
      rain, the puddles in the street, the gray skies&mdash;London, in short, at
      her ugliest and worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; Peter protested, &ldquo;but I have left several other
      things behind, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As, for instance?&rdquo; Sogrange inquired, genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; Peter informed him. &ldquo;Violet objects very much to these abrupt
      separations. This week, too, I was shooting at Saxthorpe, and I had also
      several other engagements of a pleasant nature. Besides, I have reached
      that age when I find it disconcerting to be called out of bed in the
      middle of the night to answer a long distance telephone call, and told to
      embark on a White Star liner leaving Liverpool early the next morning. It
      may be your idea of a pleasure trip. It isn&rsquo;t mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange was amused. His smile, however, was hidden. Only the tip of his
      cigarette was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing much, except that I am always seasick,&rdquo; Peter replied
      deliberately. &ldquo;I can feel it coming on now. I wish that fellow would keep
      away with his beastly mutton broth. The whole ship seems to smell of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange laughed, softly but without disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said anything about a pleasure trip?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did. You told me when you came on at Cherbourg that you had to go to
      New York to look after some property there, that things were very quiet in
      London, and that you hated traveling alone. Therefore, you sent for me at
      a few hours&rsquo; notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what I told you?&rdquo; Sogrange murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Wasn&rsquo;t it true?&rdquo; Peter asked, suddenly alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word of it,&rdquo; Sogrange admitted. &ldquo;It is quite amazing that you
      should have believed it for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a fool,&rdquo; Peter confessed. &ldquo;You see, I was tired and a little cross.
      Besides, somehow or other, I never associated a trip to America with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange interrupted him quietly, but ruthlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lift up the label attached to the chair next to yours. Read it out to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter took it into his hand and turned it over. A quick exclamation
      escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens! The Count von Hern&mdash;Bernadine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; Sogrange assented. &ldquo;Nice clear writing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter sat bolt upright in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that Bernadine is on board?&rdquo; Sogrange shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the exercise, my dear Baron,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of a superlative amount of
      ingenuity, I was able to prevent that misfortune. Now lean over and read
      the label on the next chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter obeyed. His manner had acquired a new briskness. &ldquo;La Duchesse della
      Nermino,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything just as it should be,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Change those labels, my
      friend, as quickly as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter&rsquo;s fingers were nimble and the thing was done in a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am to sit next the Spanish lady,&rdquo; he remarked, feeling for his tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only that, but you are to make friends with her,&rdquo; Sogrange replied.
      &ldquo;You are to be your captivating self, Baron. The Duchesse is to forget her
      weakness for hot rooms. She is to develop a taste for sea air and your
      society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she,&rdquo; Peter asked, anxiously, &ldquo;old or young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange showed a disposition to fence with the question. &ldquo;Not old,&rdquo; he
      answered; &ldquo;certainly not old. Fifteen years ago she was considered to be
      one of the most beautiful women in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ladies of Spain,&rdquo; Peter remarked, with a sigh, &ldquo;are inclined to
      mature early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In some cases,&rdquo; Sogrange assured him, &ldquo;there are no women in the world
      who preserve their good looks longer. You shall judge, my friend. Madame
      comes! How about that sea-sickness now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; Peter declared, briskly. &ldquo;Absolutely a fancy of mine. Never felt
      better in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An imposing little procession approached along the deck. There was the
      deck steward leading the way; a very smart French maid carrying a
      wonderful collection of wraps, cushions and books; a black-browed, pallid
      man-servant, holding a hot water bottle in his hand, and leading a tiny
      Pekinese spaniel, wrapped in a sealskin coat; and finally Madame la
      Duchesse. It was so obviously a procession intended to impress, that
      neither Peter nor Sogrange thought it worth while to conceal their
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchesse, save that she was tall and wrapped in magnificent furs,
      presented a somewhat mysterious appearance. Her features were entirely
      obscured by an unusually thick veil of black lace, and the voluminous
      nature of her outer garments only permitted a suspicion as to her figure,
      which was, at that time, at once the despair and the triumph of her
      corsetiere. With both hands she was holding her fur-lined skirts from
      contact with the deck, disclosing at the same time remarkably shapely feet
      encased in trim patent shoes with plain silver buckles, and a little more
      black silk stocking than seemed absolutely necessary. The deck steward,
      after a half-puzzled scrutiny of the labels, let down the chair next to
      the two men. The Duchesse contemplated her prospective neighbors with some
      curiosity, mingled with a certain amount of hesitation. It was at that
      moment that Sogrange, shaking away his rug, rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame la Duchesse permits me to remind her of my existence?&rdquo; he said,
      bowing low. &ldquo;It is some years since we met, but I had the honor of a dance
      at the Palace in Madrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand at once, yet somehow Peter felt sure that she was
      thankful for her veil. Her voice was pleasant, and her air the air of a
      great lady. She spoke French with the soft, sibilant intonation of the
      Spaniard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember the occasion perfectly, Marquis,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Your sister
      and I once shared a villa in Mentone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am flattered by your recollection, Duchesse,&rdquo; Sogrange murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great surprise to meet with you here, though,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I
      did not see you at Cherbourg or on the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I motored from Paris,&rdquo; Sogrange explained, &ldquo;and arrived, contrary to my
      custom, I must confess, somewhat early. Will you permit that I introduce
      an acquaintance, whom I have been fortunate enough to find on board&mdash;Monsieur
      le Baron de Grost&mdash;Madame la Duchesse della Nermino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was graciously received and the conversation dealt, for a few
      moments, with the usual banalities of the voyage. Then followed the
      business of settling the Duchesse in her place. When she was really
      installed, and surrounded with all the paraphernalia of a great and
      fanciful lady, including a handful of long cigarettes, she raised for the
      first time her veil. Peter, who was at the moment engaged in conversation
      with her, was a little shocked by the result. Her features were worn, her
      face dead-white, with many signs of the ravages wrought by the constant
      use of cosmetics. Only her eyes had retained something of their former
      splendor. These latter were almost violet in color, deep-set, with dark
      rims, and were sufficient almost in themselves to make one forget for a
      moment the less prepossessing details of her appearance. A small library
      of books was by her side, but after a while she no longer pretended any
      interest in them. She was a born conversationalist, a creature of her
      country entirely and absolutely feminine, to whom the subtle and
      flattering deference of the other sex was the breath of life itself. Peter
      burned his homage upon her altar with a craft which amounted to genius. In
      less than half an hour, Madame la Duchesse was looking many years younger.
      The vague look of apprehension had passed from her face. Their voices had
      sunk to a confidential undertone, punctuated often by the music of her
      laughter. Sogrange, with a murmured word of apology, had slipped away long
      ago. Decidedly, for an Englishman, Peter was something of a marvel!
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame la Duchesse moved her head towards the empty chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a great friend of yours&mdash;the Marquis de Sogrange?&rdquo; she asked,
      with a certain inflection in her tone which Peter was not slow to notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed no!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;A few years ago I was frequently in Paris. I
      made his acquaintance then, but we have met very seldom since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not traveling together, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means. I recognized him only as he boarded the steamer at
      Cherbourg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not a popular man in our world,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;One speaks of him
      as a schemer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything left to scheme for in France?&rdquo; Peter asked, carelessly.
      &ldquo;He is, perhaps, a monarchist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His ancestry alone would compel a devoted allegiance to royalism,&rdquo; the
      Duchesse declared, &ldquo;but I do not think that he is interested in any of
      these futile plots to reinstate the House of Orleans. I, Monsieur le
      Baron, am Spanish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have scarcely lived so far out of the world as to have heard nothing of
      the Duchesse della Nermino,&rdquo; Peter replied with empressement. &ldquo;The last
      time I saw you, Duchesse, you were in the suite of the Infanta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like all Englishmen, I see you possess a memory,&rdquo; she said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duchesse,&rdquo; Peter answered, lowering his voice, &ldquo;without the memories
      which one is fortunate enough to collect as one passes along, life would
      be a dreary place. The most beautiful things in the world cannot remain
      always with us. It is well, then, that the shadow of them can be recalled
      to us in the shape of dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes rewarded him for his gallantry. Peter felt that he was doing very
      well indeed. He indulged himself in a brief silence. Presently she
      returned to the subject of Sogrange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;that of all the men in the world I expected
      least to see the Marquis de Sogrange on board a steamer bound for New
      York. What can a man of his type find to amuse him in the New World?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One wonders, indeed,&rdquo; Peter assented. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, I did read in
      a newspaper a few days ago that he was going to Mexico in connection with
      some excavations there. He spoke to me of it just now. They seem to have
      discovered a ruined temple of the Incas, or something of the sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchesse breathed what sounded very much like a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had forgotten,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;that New York itself need not
      necessarily be his destination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my own part,&rdquo; Peter continued, &ldquo;it is quite amazing, the interest
      which the evening papers always take in the movements of one connected
      ever so slightly with their world. I think that a dozen newspapers have
      told their readers the exact amount of money I am going to lend or borrow
      in New York, the stocks I am going to bull or bear, the mines I am going
      to purchase. My presence on an American steamer is accounted for by the
      journalists a dozen times over. Yours, Duchesse, if one might say so
      without appearing over curious, seems the most inexplicable. What
      attraction can America possibly have for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him covertly from under her sleepy eyelids. Peter&rsquo;s face
      was like the face of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not, perhaps, know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I was born in Cuba. I lived
      there, in fact, for many years. I still have estates in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Are you interested, then, in this reported salvage
      of the Maine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence. Peter, who had not been looking at her when he
      had asked his question, turned his head, surprised at her lack of
      response. His heart gave a little jump. The Duchesse had all the
      appearance of a woman on the point of fainting. One hand was holding a
      scent bottle to her nose; the other, thin and white, ablaze with emeralds
      and diamonds, was gripping the side of her chair. Her expression was one
      of blank terror. Peter felt a shiver chill his own blood at the things he
      saw in her face. He himself was confused, apologetic, yet absolutely
      without understanding. His thoughts reverted at first to his own
      commonplace malady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are ill, Duchesse!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You will allow me to call the deck
      steward? Or perhaps you would prefer your own maid? I have some brandy in
      this flask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had thrown off his rug, but her imperious gesture kept him seated. She
      was looking at him with an intentness which was almost tragical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you ask me that question?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      His innocence was entirely apparent. Not even Peter could have dissembled
      so naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That question?&rdquo; he repeated, vaguely. &ldquo;You mean about the Maine? It was
      the idlest chance, Duchesse, I assure you. I saw something about it in the
      paper yesterday and it seemed interesting. But if I had had the slightest
      idea that the subject was distasteful to you, I would not have dreamed of
      mentioning it. Even now&mdash;I do not understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him. All the time he had been speaking she had shown signs
      of recovery. She was smiling now, faintly and with obvious effort, but
      still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is altogether my own fault, Baron,&rdquo; she admitted, graciously. &ldquo;Please
      forgive my little fit of emotion. The subject is a very sore one among my
      countrypeople, and your sudden mention of it upset me. It was very
      foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duchesse, I was a clumsy idiot!&rdquo; Peter declared, penitently. &ldquo;I deserve
      that you should be unkind to me for the rest of the voyage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not afford that,&rdquo; she answered, forcing another smile. &ldquo;I am
      relying too much upon you for companionship. Ah! could I trouble you?&rdquo; she
      added. &ldquo;For the moment I need my maid. She passes there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter sprang up and called the young woman, who was slowly pacing the
      deck. He himself did not at once return to his place. He went instead in
      search of Sogrange, and found him in his stateroom. Sogrange was lying
      upon a couch, in a silk smoking suit, with a French novel in his hand and
      an air of contentment which was almost fatuous. He laid down the volume at
      Peter&rsquo;s entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Baron,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;why this haste! No one is ever in a hurry upon
      a steamer. Remember that we can&rsquo;t possibly get anywhere in less than eight
      days, and there is no task in the world, nowadays, which cannot be
      accomplished in that time. To hurry is a needless waste of tissue, and, to
      a person of my nervous temperament, exceedingly unpleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter sat down on the edge of the bunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume you have quite finished?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If so, listen to me. I am
      moving in the dark. Is it my fault that I blunder? By the merest accident
      I have already committed a hideous faux pas. You ought to have warned me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have spoken to the Duchesse of the Maine disaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of Sogrange gleamed for a moment, but he lay perfectly still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;A good many people are talking about it. It is one
      of the strangest things I have ever heard of, that after all these years
      they should be trying to salve the wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems worse than strange,&rdquo; Peter declared. &ldquo;What can be the use of
      trying to stir up bitter feelings between two nations who have fought
      their battles and buried the hatchet? I call it an act of insanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A bugle rang. Sogrange yawned and sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind touching the bell for my servant, Baron,&rdquo; he asked.
      &ldquo;Dinner will be served in half an hour. Afterwards, we will talk, you and
      I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter turned away, not wholly pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner, the better,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;or I shall be putting my foot into
      it again.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, the two men walked on deck together. The night was dark but
      fine, with a strong wind blowing from the northwest. The deck steward
      called their attention to a long line of lights, stealing up from the
      horizon on their starboard side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Lusitania, sir. She&rsquo;ll be up to us in half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They leaned over the rail. Soon the blue fires began to play about their
      mast head. Sogrange watched them thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one could only read those messages,&rdquo; he remarked, with a sigh, &ldquo;it
      might help us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter knocked the ash from his cigar and was silent for a time. He was
      beginning to understand the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I have been doing you an injustice. I have
      come to the conclusion that you are not keeping me in ignorance of the
      vital facts connected with our visit to America, willfully. At the present
      moment you know just a little more, but a very little more than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What perception!&rdquo; Sogrange murmured. &ldquo;My dear Baron, sometimes you amaze
      me. You are absolutely right. I have some pieces and I am convinced that
      they would form a puzzle the solution of which would be interesting to us,
      but how or where they fit in, I frankly don&rsquo;t know. You have the facts so
      far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Peter replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard of Sirdeller?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the Sirdeller?&rdquo; Peter asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. I mean the man whose very movements sway the money markets of
      the world, the man who could, if he chose, ruin any nation, make war
      impossible; who could if he had ten more years of life and was allowed to
      live, draw to himself and his own following the entire wealth of the
      universe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very eloquent,&rdquo; Peter remarked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the rest for granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Sogrange continued, &ldquo;you have probably also heard of Don Pedro,
      Prince of Marsine, one time Pretender to the Throne of Spain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a striking figure in European politics,&rdquo; Peter assented, quickly.
      &ldquo;He is suspected of radical proclivities, and is still, it is rumored, an
      active plotter against the existing monarchy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Sogrange said. &ldquo;Now listen carefully. Four months ago,
      Sirdeller was living at the Golden Villa, near Nice. He was visited more
      than once by Marsine, introduced by the Count von Hern. The result of
      those visits was a long series of cablegrams to certain great engineering
      firms in America. Almost immediately, the salvage of the Maine was
      started. It is a matter of common report that the entire cost of these
      works is being undertaken by Sirdeller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Peter murmured, &ldquo;you are really beginning to interest me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This week,&rdquo; Sogrange went on, &ldquo;it is expected that the result of the
      salvage works will be made known. That is to say, it is highly possible
      that the question of whether the Maine was blown up from outside or
      inside, will be settled once and for all. This week, mind, Baron. Now see
      what happens. Sirdeller returns to America. The Count von Hern and Prince
      Marsine come to America. The Duchesse della Nermino comes to America. The
      Duchesse, Sirdeller and Marsine are upon this steamer. The Count von Hern
      travels by the Lusitania only because it was reported that Sirdeller at
      the last minute changed his mind and was traveling by that boat. Mix these
      things up in your brain&mdash;the conjurer&rsquo;s hat, let us call it,&rdquo;
       Sogrange concluded, laying his hand upon Peter&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;Sirdeller, the
      Duchesse, Von Hern, Marsine, the raising of the Maine&mdash;mix them up
      and what sort of an omelette appears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter whistled softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you couldn&rsquo;t make the pieces of the puzzle
      fit. Tell me more about the Duchesse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange considered for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The principal thing about her which links her with the present
      situation,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;is that she was living in Cuba at the time of
      the Maine disaster, married to a rich Cuban.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The affair was suddenly illuminated by the searchlight of romance. Peter,
      for the first time, saw not the light, but the possibility of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marsine has been living in Germany, has he not?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a personal friend of the Kaiser,&rdquo; Sogrange replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both looked up and listened to the crackling of the electricity above
      their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect Bernadine is a little annoyed,&rdquo; Peter remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t pleasant to be out of the party,&rdquo; Sogrange agreed. &ldquo;Nearly
      everybody, however, believed at the last moment that Sirdeller had
      transferred his passage to the Lusitania.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to cost him an awful lot in marconigrams,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;By the
      bye, wouldn&rsquo;t it have been better for us to have traveled separately, and
      incognito?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange shrugged his shoulders slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Von Hern has at least one man on board,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I do not think that
      we could possibly have escaped observation. Besides, I rather imagine that
      any move we are able to make in this matter must come before we reach Fire
      Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any theory at all?&rdquo; Peter asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the ghost of a one,&rdquo; Sogrange admitted. &ldquo;One more fact, though, I
      forgot to mention. You may find it important. The Duchesse comes entirely
      against Von Hern&rsquo;s wishes. They have been on intimate terms for years, but
      for some reason or other he was exceedingly anxious that she should not
      take this voyage. She, on the other hand, seemed to have some equally
      strong reason for coming. The most useful piece of advice I could give you
      would be to cultivate her acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duchesse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter never finished his sentence. His companion drew him suddenly back
      into the shadow of a lifeboat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A door had opened from lower down the deck, and a curious little
      procession was coming towards them. A man, burly and broad-shouldered, who
      had the air of a professional bully, walked by himself ahead. Two others
      of similar build walked a few steps behind. And between them a thin,
      insignificant figure, wrapped in an immense fur coat and using a strong
      walking stick, came slowly along the deck. It was like a procession of
      prison warders guarding a murderer, or perhaps a nerve-racked royal
      personage moving the end of his days in the midst of enemies. With halting
      steps the little old man came shambling along. He looked neither to the
      left nor to the right. His eyes were fixed and yet unseeing, his features
      were pale and bony. There was no gleam of life, not even in the stone-cold
      eyes. Like some machine-made man of a new and physically degenerate age,
      he took his exercise under the eye of his doctor, a strange and
      miserable-looking object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes Sirdeller,&rdquo; Sogrange whispered. &ldquo;Look at him&mdash;the man
      whose might is greater than any emperor&rsquo;s. There is no haven in the
      universe to which he does not hold the key. Look at him&mdash;master of
      the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shivered. There was something depressing in the sight of that
      mournful procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He neither smokes nor drinks,&rdquo; Sogrange continued. &ldquo;Women, as a sex, do
      not exist for him. His religion is a doubting Calvinism. He has a doctor
      and a clergyman always by his side to inject life and hope if they can.
      Look at him well, my friend. He represents a great moral lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;I am going to take the taste of him out of my
      mouth with a whiskey and soda. Afterwards, I&rsquo;m for the Duchesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Duchesse, apparently, was not for Peter. He found her in the
      music-room with several of the little Marconi missives spread out before
      her, and she cut him dead. Peter, however, was a brave man, and skilled at
      the game of bluff. So he stopped by her side and without any preamble
      addressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duchesse,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are a woman of perceptions. Which do you
      believe, then, in your heart to be the more trustworthy&mdash;the Count
      von Hern or I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She simply stared at him. He continued promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have received your warning, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the Count von Hern. Why believe what he says? He may be a friend of
      yours&mdash;he may be a dear friend&mdash;but in your heart you know that
      he is both unscrupulous and selfish. Why accept his word and distrust me?
      I, at least, am honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Whose word have I for that save your own? And
      what concern is it of mine if you possess every one of the bourgeois
      qualities in the world? You are presuming, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend Sogrange will tell you that I am to be trusted,&rdquo; Peter
      persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no reason why I should trouble myself about your personal
      characteristics,&rdquo; she replied, coldly. &ldquo;They do not interest me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, Duchesse,&rdquo; Peter continued, fencing wildly, &ldquo;you have
      never in your life been more in need of any one&rsquo;s services than you are of
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conflict was uneven. The Duchesse was a nervous, highly strung woman.
      The calm assurance of Peter&rsquo;s manner oppressed her with a sense of his
      mastery. She sank back upon the couch from which she had arisen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would tell me what you mean,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have no right to
      talk to me in this fashion. What have you to do with my affairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have as much to do with them as the Count von Hem,&rdquo; Peter insisted,
      boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known the Count von Hern,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;for very many years. You
      have been a shipboard acquaintance of mine for a few hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have known the Count von Hern for many years,&rdquo; Peter asserted,
      &ldquo;you have found out by this time that he is an absolutely untrustworthy
      person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing he is,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you tell me what concern it is of
      yours? Do you suppose for one moment that I am likely to discuss my
      private affairs with a perfect stranger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no private affairs,&rdquo; Peter declared, sternly. &ldquo;They are the
      affairs of a nation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him with a little shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment he felt that he was gaining ground. She looked around the
      room. It was still filled, but in their corner they were almost
      unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you know?&rdquo; she asked in a low tone which shook with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled enigmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps more, even, than you, Duchesse,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I should like to be
      your friend. You need one&mdash;you know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose abruptly to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For to-night it is enough,&rdquo; she declared, wrapping her fur cloak around
      her. &ldquo;You may talk to me to-morrow, Baron. I must think. If you desire
      really to be my friend, there is, perhaps, one service which I may require
      of you. But to-night, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter stood aside and allowed her to step past him. He was perfectly
      content with the progress he had made. Her farewell salute was by no means
      ungracious. As soon as she was out of sight, he returned to the couch
      where she had been sitting. She had taken away the marconigrams, but she
      had left upon the floor several copies of the New York Herald. He took
      them up and read them carefully through. The last one he found
      particularly interesting, so much so that he folded it up, placed it in
      his coat pocket, and went off to look for Sogrange, whom he found at last
      in the saloon, watching a noisy game of &ldquo;Up Jenkins!&rdquo; Peter sank upon the
      cushioned seat by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Bernadine has been busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the Duchesse is not proving faithless?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far,&rdquo; Peter replied, &ldquo;I have kept my end up. Tomorrow will be the
      test. Bernadine had filled her with caution. She thinks that I know
      everything&mdash;whatever everything may be. Unless I can discover a
      little more than I do now, to-morrow is going to be an exceedingly awkward
      day for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is every prospect of your acquiring a great deal of valuable
      information before then,&rdquo; Sogrange declared. &ldquo;Sit tight, my friend.
      Something is going to happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the threshold of the saloon, ushered in by one of the stewards, a tall,
      powerful-looking man, with a square, well-trimmed black beard, was
      standing looking around as though in search of some one. The steward
      pointed out, with an unmistakable movement of his head, Peter and
      Sogrange. The man approached and took the next table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steward,&rdquo; he directed, &ldquo;bring me a glass of Vermouth and some dominoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter&rsquo;s eyes were suddenly bright. Sogrange touched his foot under the
      table and whispered a word of warning. The dominoes were brought. The
      newcomer arranged them as though for a game. Then he calmly withdrew the
      double-four and laid it before Sogrange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been my misfortune, Marquis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;never to have made your
      acquaintance, although our mutual friends are many, and I think I may say
      that I have the right to claim a certain amount of consideration from you
      and your associates. You know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Prince,&rdquo; Sogrange replied. &ldquo;I am charmed. Permit me to present
      my friend, the Baron de Grost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The newcomer bowed and glanced a little nervously around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will permit me,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I travel incognito. I have lived so long
      in England that I have permitted myself the name of an Englishman. I am
      traveling under the name of Mr. James Fanshawe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fanshawe, by all means,&rdquo; Sogrange agreed. &ldquo;In the meantime&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I claim my rights as a corresponding member of the Double-Four,&rdquo; the
      newcomer declared. &ldquo;My friend the Count von Hern finds menace to certain
      plans of ours in your presence upon this steamer. Unknown to him, I come
      to you openly. I claim your aid, not your enmity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us understand one another clearly,&rdquo; Sogrange said. &ldquo;You claim our aid
      in what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fanshawe glanced around the saloon and lowered his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I claim your aid towards the overthrowing of the usurping House of
      Brangaza and the restoration to power in Spain of my own line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange was silent for several moments. Peter was leaning forward in his
      place, deeply interested. Decidedly, this American trip seemed destined to
      lead towards events!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our active aid towards such an end,&rdquo; Sogrange said at last, &ldquo;is
      impossible. The Society of the Double-Four does not interfere in the
      domestic policy of other nations for the sake of individual members.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me ask you why I find you upon this steamer?&rdquo; Mr. Fanshawe
      demanded, in a tone of suppressed excitement. &ldquo;Is it for the sea voyage
      that you and your friend the Baron de Grost cross the Atlantic this
      particular week, on the same steamer as myself, as Mr. Sirdeller, and&mdash;and
      the Duchesse? One does not believe in such coincidences! One is driven to
      conclude that it is your intention to interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The affair almost demands our interference,&rdquo; Sogrange replied, smoothly.
      &ldquo;With every due respect to you, Prince, there are great interests involved
      in this move of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince was a big man, but for all his large features and bearded face
      his expression was the expression of a peevish and passionate child. He
      controlled himself with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marquis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is necessary&mdash;I say that it is necessary
      that we conclude an alliance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange nodded approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well spoken,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but remember&mdash;the Baron de Grost
      represents England and the English interests of our Society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince of Marsine&rsquo;s face was not pleasant to look upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me if you are an Englishman by birth, Baron,&rdquo; he said, turning
      towards him, &ldquo;but a more interfering nation in other people&rsquo;s affairs than
      England has never existed in the pages of history. She must have a finger
      in every pie. Bah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter leaned over from his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Germany&mdash;Mr. Fanshawe?&rdquo; he asked, with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince tugged at his beard. He was a little nonplussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count von Hern,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;has been a good friend to me. The
      rulers of his country have always been hospitable and favorably inclined
      towards my family. The whole affair is of his design. I myself could
      scarcely have moved in it alone. One must reward one&rsquo;s helpers. There is
      no reason, however,&rdquo; he added, with a meaning glance at Peter, &ldquo;why other
      helpers should not be admitted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reward which you offer to the Count von Hern,&rdquo; Peter remarked, &ldquo;is of
      itself absolutely inimical to the interests of my country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; the Prince demanded, tapping the table before him. &ldquo;It is true
      that within a year I am pledged to reward the Count von Hern in certain
      fashion. It is not possible that you know the terms of our compact, but
      from your words it is possible that you have guessed. Very well. Accept
      this from me. Remain neutral now, allow this matter to proceed to its
      natural conclusion, let your government address representations to me when
      the time comes, adopting a bold front, and I promise that I will obey
      them. It will not be my fault that I am compelled to disappoint the Count
      von Hern. My seaboard would be at the mercy of your fleet. Superior force
      must be obeyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a matter, this,&rdquo; Sogrange said, &ldquo;for discussion between my friend
      and me. I think that you will find that we are neither of us unreasonable.
      In short, Prince, I see no insuperable reason why we should not come to
      terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You encourage me,&rdquo; the Prince declared, in a gratified tone. &ldquo;Do not
      believe, Marquis, that I am actuated in this matter wholly by motives of
      personal ambition. No, it is not so. A great desire has burned always in
      my heart, but it is not that alone which moves me. I assure you that of my
      certain knowledge Spain is honeycombed&mdash;is rotten with treason. A
      revolution is a certainty. How much better that that revolution should be
      conducted in a dignified manner; that I, with my reputation for democracy
      which I have carefully kept before the eyes of my people, should be
      elected President of the new Spanish Republic, even if it is the gold of
      the American which places me there. In a year or two, what may happen who
      can say? This craving for a republic is but a passing dream. Spain, at
      heart, is monarchial. She will be led back to the light. It is but a short
      step from the president&rsquo;s chair to the throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange and his companion sat quite still. They avoided looking at each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing more,&rdquo; the Prince continued, dropping his voice, as
      if, even at that distance, he feared the man of whom he spoke. &ldquo;I shall
      not inform the Count von Hern of our conversation. It is not necessary,
      and, between ourselves, the Count is jealous. He sends me message after
      message that I remain in my stateroom, that I seek no interview with
      Sirdeller, that I watch only. He is too much of the spy&mdash;the Count
      von Hern. He does not understand that code of honor, relying upon which I
      open my heart to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done your cause no harm,&rdquo; Sogrange assured him, with subtle
      sarcasm. &ldquo;We come now to the Duchesse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince leaned towards him. It was just at this moment that a steward
      entered with a marconigram, which he presented to the Prince. The latter
      tore it open, glanced it through, and gave vent to a little exclamation.
      The fingers which held the missive trembled. His eyes blazed with
      excitement. He was absolutely unable to control his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My two friends,&rdquo; he cried, in a tone broken with emotion, &ldquo;it is you
      first who shall hear the news! This message has just arrived. Sirdeller
      will have received its duplicate. The final report of the works in Havana
      Harbor will await us on our arrival in New York, but the substance of it
      is this. The Maine was sunk by a torpedo, discharged at close quarters
      underneath her magazine. Gentlemen, the House of Brangaza is ruined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a breathless silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your information is genuine?&rdquo; Sogrange asked, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt,&rdquo; the Prince replied. &ldquo;I have been expecting this
      message. I shall cable to Von Hern. We are still in communication. He may
      not have heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were about to speak of the Duchesse,&rdquo; Peter reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another time,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Another time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried away. It was already half past ten and the saloon was almost
      empty. The steward came up to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The saloon is being closed for the night, sir,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go on deck,&rdquo; Peter suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found their way up on to the windward side of the promenade, which
      was absolutely deserted. Far away in front of them now were the
      disappearing lights of the Lusitania. The wind roared by as the great
      steamer rose and fell on the black stretch of waters. Peter stood very
      near to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Sogrange,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the affair is clear now save for one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Sirdeller&rsquo;s motives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Peter answered. &ldquo;An hour ago, I came across the explanation
      of these. The one thing I will tell you afterwards. Now listen. Sirdeller
      came abroad last year for twelve months&rsquo; travel. He took a great house in
      San Sebastian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you hear this?&rdquo; Sogrange asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read the story in the New York Herald,&rdquo; Peter continued. &ldquo;It is grossly
      exaggerated, of course, but this is the substance of it. Sirdeller and his
      suite were stopped upon the Spanish frontier and treated in an abominable
      fashion by the customs officers. He was forced to pay a very large sum,
      unjustly I should think. He paid under protest, appealed to the
      authorities, with no result. At San Sebastian he was robbed right and
      left, his privacy intruded upon. In short, he took a violent dislike and
      hatred to the country and every one concerned in it. He moved with his
      entire suite to Nice, to the Golden Villa. There he expressed himself
      freely concerning Spain and her Government. Count von Hern heard of it and
      presented Marsine. The plot was, without doubt, Bernadine&rsquo;s. Can&rsquo;t you
      imagine how he would put it? &lsquo;A revolution,&rsquo; he would tell Sirdeller, &lsquo;is
      imminent in Spain. Here is the new President of the Republic. Money is no
      more to you than water. You are a patriotic American. Have you forgotten
      that a warship of your country with six hundred of her devoted citizens
      was sent to the bottom by the treachery of one of this effete race? The
      war was an inefficient revenge. The country still flourishes. It is for
      you to avenge America. With money Marsine can establish a republic in
      Spain within twenty-four hours.&rsquo; Sirdeller hesitates. He would point out
      that it had never been proved that the destruction of the Maine was really
      due to Spanish treachery. It is the idea of a business man which followed.
      He, at his own expense, would raise the Maine. If it were true that the
      explosion occurred from outside, he would find the money. You see, the
      message has arrived. After all these years the sea has given up its
      secret. Marsine will return to Spain with an unlimited credit behind him.
      The House of Brangaza will crumble up like a pack of cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange looked out into the darkness. Perhaps he saw in that great black
      gulf the pictures of these happenings which his companion had prophesied.
      Perhaps, for a moment, he saw the panorama of a city in flames, the
      passing of a great country under the thrall of these new ideas. At any
      rate, he turned abruptly away from the side of the vessel, and taking
      Peter&rsquo;s arm, walked slowly down the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have solved the puzzle, Baron,&rdquo; he said, gravely. &ldquo;Now tell me the
      one thing. Your story seems to dovetail everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one thing,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;is connected with the Duchesse. It was she,
      of her own will, who decided to come to America. I believe that, but for
      her coming, Bernadine and the Prince would have waited in their own
      country. Money can flash from America to England over the wires. It does
      not need to be fetched. They have still one fear. It is connected with the
      Duchesse. Let me think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked up and down the deck. The lights were extinguished one by one,
      except in the smoking-room. A strange breed of sailors from the lower deck
      came up with mops and buckets. The wind changed its quarter and the great
      ship began to roll. Peter stopped abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find this motion most unpleasant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am going to bed.
      To-night I cannot think. To-morrow, I promise you, we will solve this.
      Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand and drew his companion back into the shadow of a
      lifeboat. A tall figure was approaching them along the deck. As he passed
      the little ray of light thrown out from the smoking-room, the man&rsquo;s
      features were clearly visible. It was the Prince. He was walking like one
      absorbed in thought. His eyes were set like a sleep-walker&rsquo;s. With one
      hand he gesticulated. The fingers of the other were twitching all the
      time. His head was lifted to the skies. There was something in his face
      which redeemed it from its disfiguring petulance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the man who dreams of power,&rdquo; Peter whispered. &ldquo;It is one of his
      best moments, this. He forgets the vulgar means by which he intends to
      rise. He thinks only of himself, the dictator, king, perhaps emperor. He
      is of the breed of egoists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again and again the Prince passed, manifestly unconscious even of his
      whereabouts. Peter and Sogrange crept away unseen to their staterooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many respects the room resembled a miniature court of justice. The
      principal sitting-room of the royal suite, which was the chief glory of
      the Adriatic, had been stripped of every superfluous article of furniture
      or embellishment. Curtains had been removed, all evidences of luxury
      disposed of. Temporarily the apartment had been transformed into a bare,
      cheerless place. Seated on a high chair, with his back to the wall, was
      Sirdeller. At his right hand was a small table, on which stood a glass of
      milk, a phial, a stethoscope. Behind his doctor. At his left hand a
      smooth-faced, silent young man&mdash;his secretary. Before him stood the
      Duchesse, Peter and Sogrange. Guarding the door was one of the watchmen,
      who, from his great physique, might well have been a policeman out of
      livery. Sirdeller himself, in the clear light which streamed through the
      large window, seemed more aged and shrunken than ever. His eyes were deep
      set. No tinge of color was visible in his cheeks. His chin protruded, his
      shaggy gray eyebrows gave him an unkempt appearance. He wore a black
      velvet gown, a strangely cut black morning coat and trousers, felt
      slippers, and his hands were clasped upon a stout ash walking-stick. He
      eyed the newcomers keenly but without expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady may sit,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke almost in an undertone, as though anxious to avoid the fatigue of
      words. The guardian of the door placed a chair, into which the Duchesse
      subsided. Sirdeller held his right hand towards his doctor, who felt his
      pulse. All the time Sirdeller watched him, his lips a little parted, a
      world of hungry excitement in his eyes. The doctor closed his watch with a
      snap and whispered something in Sirdeller&rsquo;s ear, apparently reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will hear this story,&rdquo; Sirdeller announced. &ldquo;In two minutes every one
      must leave. If it takes longer, it must remain unfinished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter spoke up briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The story is this,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;You have promised to assist the Prince of
      Marsine to transform Spain into a republic, providing the salvage
      operations on the Maine prove that that ship was destroyed from outside.
      The salvage operations have been conducted at your expense and finished.
      It has been proved that the Maine was destroyed by a mine or torpedo from
      the outside. Therefore, on the assumption that it was the treacherous deed
      of a Spaniard or Cuban imagining himself to be a patriot, you are prepared
      to carry out your undertaking and supply the Prince of Marsine with means
      to overthrow the Kingdom of Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter paused. The figure on the chair remained motionless. No flicker of
      intelligence or interest disturbed the calm of his features. It was a
      silence almost unnatural. &ldquo;I have brought the Duchesse here,&rdquo; Peter
      continued, &ldquo;to tell you the truth as to the Maine disaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not even then was there the slightest alteration in those ashen gray
      features. The Duchesse looked up. She had the air of one only too eager to
      speak and finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In those days,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was the wife of a rich Cuban gentleman,
      whose name I withhold. The American officers on board the Maine used to
      visit at our house. My husband was jealous; perhaps he had cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchesse paused. Even though the light of tragedy and romance side by
      side seemed suddenly to creep into the room, Sirdeller listened as one
      come back from a dead world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One night,&rdquo; the Duchesse went on, &ldquo;my husband&rsquo;s suspicions were changed
      into knowledge. He came home unexpectedly. The American&mdash;the officer&mdash;I
      loved him&mdash;he was there on the balcony with me. My husband said
      nothing. The officer returned to the ship. That night my husband came into
      my room. He bent over my bed. &lsquo;It is not you,&rsquo; he whispered, &lsquo;whom I shall
      destroy, for the pain of death is short. Anguish of mind may live.
      To-night six hundred ghosts may hang about your pillow!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice broke. There was something grim and unnatural in that curious
      stillness. Even the secretary was at last breathing a little faster. The
      watchman at the door was leaning forward. Sirdeller simply moved his hand
      to the doctor, who held up his finger while he felt the pulse. The beat of
      his watch seemed to sound through the unnatural silence. In a minute he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady may proceed,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband,&rdquo; the Duchesse continued, &ldquo;was an officer in charge of the
      Mines and Ordnance Department. He went out that night in a small boat,
      after a visit to the strong house. No soul has ever seen or heard of him
      since, or his boat. It is only I who know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice died away. Sirdeller stretched out his hand and very
      deliberately drank a tablespoonful or two of his milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe the lady&rsquo;s story,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;The Marsine affair is
      finished. Let no one be admitted to have speech with me again upon this
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had half turned towards his secretary. The young man bowed. The doctor
      pointed towards the door. The Duchesse, Peter and Sogrange filed slowly
      out. In the bright sunlight the Duchesse burst into a peal of hysterical
      laughter. Even Peter felt, for a moment, unnerved. Suddenly he, too,
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you and I had better get out of the way,
      Sogrange, when the Count von Hern meets us at New York!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE AFFAIR or AN ALIEN SOCIETY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sogrange and Peter, Baron de Grost, standing upon the threshold of their
      hotel, gazed out upon New York and liked the look of it. They had landed
      from the steamer a few hours before, had already enjoyed the luxury of a
      bath, a visit to an American barber&rsquo;s, and a genuine cocktail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no reason,&rdquo; Sogrange declared, &ldquo;why we should not take a week&rsquo;s
      holiday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter, glancing up into the blue sky and down into the faces of the
      well-dressed and beautiful women who were streaming up Fifth Avenue, was
      wholly of the same mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we return by this afternoon&rsquo;s steamer,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;we shall have
      Bernadine for a fellow passenger. Bernadine is annoyed with us just now. I
      must confess that I should feel more at my ease with a few thousand miles
      of the Atlantic between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be so,&rdquo; Sogrange assented. &ldquo;We will explore this marvelous city.
      Never,&rdquo; he added, taking his companion&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;did I expect to see such
      women save in my own, the mistress of all cities. So chic, my dear Baron,
      and such a carriage! We will lunch at one of the fashionable restaurants
      and drive in the Park afterwards. First of all, however, we must take a
      stroll along this wonderful Fifth Avenue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men spent a morning after their own hearts. They lunched
      astonishingly well at Sherry&rsquo;s and drove afterwards in Central Park. When
      they returned to the hotel, Sogrange was in excellent spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel, my friend,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;that we are going to have a very
      pleasant and, in some respects, a unique week. To meet friends and
      acquaintances, everywhere, as one must do in every capital in Europe, is,
      of course, pleasant, but there is a monotony about it from which one is
      glad sometimes to escape. We lunch here and we promenade in the places
      frequented by those of a similar station to our own, and behold! we know
      no one. We are lookers on. Perhaps for a long time it might gall. For a
      brief period there is a restfulness about it which pleases me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have liked,&rdquo; Peter murmured, &ldquo;an introduction to the lady in the
      blue hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a gregarious animal,&rdquo; Sogrange declared. &ldquo;You do not understand
      the pleasures of a little comparative isolation with an intellectual
      companion such as myself... What the devil is the meaning of this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached their sitting-room and upon a small round table stood a
      great collection of cards and notes. Sogrange took them up helplessly, one
      after the other, reading the names aloud and letting them fall through his
      fingers. Some were known to him, some were not. He began to open the
      notes. In effect they were all the same&mdash;what evening would the
      Marquis de Sogrange and his distinguished friend care to dine, lunch,
      yacht, golf, shoot, go to the opera, join a theatre party? Of what clubs
      would they care to become members? What kind of hospitality would be most
      acceptable?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange sank into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;they all have to be answered&mdash;that
      collection there! The visits have to be returned. It is magnificent, this
      hospitality, but what can one do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked at the pile of correspondence upon which Sogrange&rsquo;s inroad,
      indeed, seemed to have had but little effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One could engage a secretary, of course,&rdquo; he suggested, doubtfully. &ldquo;But
      the visits! Our week&rsquo;s holiday is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Sogrange replied. &ldquo;I have an idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The telephone bell rang. Peter took up the receiver and listened for a
      moment. He turned to Sogrange, still holding it in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be pleased, also, to hear,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;that there are half a
      dozen reporters downstairs waiting to interview [Transcriber&rsquo;s note: word
      missing].&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange received the information with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have them sent up at once,&rdquo; he directed, &ldquo;every one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, all at the same time?&rdquo; Peter asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All at the same time it must be,&rdquo; Sogrange answered. &ldquo;Give them to
      understand that it is an affair of five minutes only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They came trooping in. Sogrange welcomed them cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, the Baron de Grost,&rdquo; he explained, indicating Peter. &ldquo;I am the
      Marquis de Sogrange. Let us know what we can do to serve you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the men stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very glad to meet you, Marquis, and you, Baron,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t bother
      you with any introductions, but I and the company here represent the Press
      of New York. We should like some information for our papers as to the
      object of your visit here and the probable length of your stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange extended his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;the object of our visit was, I thought,
      already well known. We are on our way to Mexico. We leave to-night. My
      friend the Baron is, as you know, a financier. I, too, have a little money
      to invest. We are going out to meet some business acquaintances with a
      view to inspecting some mining properties. That is absolutely all I can
      tell you. You can understand, of course, that fuller information would be
      impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s quite natural, Marquis,&rdquo; the spokesman of the reporters
      replied. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like the idea of your hustling out of New York like
      this, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange glanced at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unavoidable,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;We are relying upon you, gentlemen, to
      publish the fact, because you will see,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the table,
      &ldquo;that we have been the recipients of a great many civilities, which it is
      impossible for us to acknowledge properly. If it will give you any
      pleasure to see us upon our return, you will be very welcome. In the
      meantime, you will understand our haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were a few more civilities and the representatives of the Press took
      their departure. Peter looked at his companion doubtfully, as Sogrange
      returned from showing them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose this means that we have to catch to-day&rsquo;s steamer, after all?&rdquo;
       he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; Sogrange answered. &ldquo;I have a plan. We will leave for
      the Southern depot, wherever it may be. Afterwards, you shall use that
      wonderful skill of yours, of which I have heard so much, to effect some
      slight change in our appearance. We will then go to another hotel, in
      another quarter of New York, and take our week&rsquo;s holiday incognito. What
      do you think of that for an idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so easy to dodge the newspapers and
      the Press in this country. Besides, although I could manage myself very
      well, you would be an exceedingly awkward subject. Your tall and elegant
      figure, your aquiline nose, the shapeliness of your hands and feet, give
      you a distinction which I should find it hard to conceal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a remarkably observant fellow, Baron. I quite appreciate your
      difficulty. Still, with a club foot, eh, and spectacles instead of my
      eyeglass&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no doubt, something could be managed,&rdquo; Peter interrupted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      really in earnest about this, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; Sogrange declared. &ldquo;Come here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew Peter to the window. They were on the twelfth story, and to a
      European there was something magnificent in that tangled mass of buildings
      threaded by the elevated railway, with its screaming trains, the clearness
      of the atmosphere, and in the white streets below, like polished belts
      through which the swarms of people streamed like insects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagine it all lit up!&rdquo; Sogrange exclaimed. &ldquo;The sky-signs all ablaze,
      the flashing of fire from those cable wires, the lights glittering from
      those tall buildings! This is a wonderful place, Baron. We must see it.
      Ring for the bill. Order one of those magnificent omnibuses. Press the
      button, too, for the personage whom they call the valet. Perhaps, with a
      little gentle persuasion, he could be induced to pack our clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his finger upon the hell, Peter hesitated. He, too, loved adventures,
      but the gloom of a presentiment had momentarily depressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are marked men, remember, Sogrange,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;An escapade of this
      sort means a certain amount of risk, even in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernadine caught the midday steamer! We have no enemies here that I know
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter pressed the button. An hour or so later, the Marquis de Sogrange and
      Peter, Baron de Grost, took their leave of New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      They chose a hotel on Broadway, within a stone&rsquo;s throw of Rector&rsquo;s. Peter,
      with whitened hair, gold-rimmed spectacles, a slouch hat and a fur coat,
      passed easily enough for an English maker of electrical instruments; while
      Sogrange, shabbier, and in ready-made American clothes, was transformed
      into a Canadian having some connection with the theatrical business. They
      plunged into the heart of New York life, and found the whole thing like a
      tonic. The intense vitality of the people, the pandemonium of Broadway at
      midnight, with its flaming illuminations, its eager crowd, its inimitable
      restlessness, fascinated them both. Sogrange, indeed, remembering the
      decadent languor of the crowds of pleasure seekers thronging his own
      boulevards, was never weary of watching these men and women. They passed
      from the streets to the restaurants, from the restaurants to the theatre,
      out into the streets again, back to the restaurants, and once more into
      the streets. Sogrange was like a glutton. The mention of bed was hateful
      to him. For three days they existed without a moment&rsquo;s boredom.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth evening, Peter found Sogrange deep in conversation with the
      head porter. In a few minutes he led Peter away to one of the bars where
      they usually took their cocktail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;to-night I have a treat for you. So far we
      have looked on at the external night life of New York. Wonderful and
      thrilling it has been, too. But there is the underneath, also. Why not?
      There is a vast polyglot population here, full of energy said life. A
      criminal class exists as a matter of course. To-night we make our bow to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by what means?&rdquo; Peter inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend the hall-porter,&rdquo; Sogrange continued, &ldquo;has given me the card
      of an ex-detective who will be our escort. He calls for us to-night, or
      rather to-morrow morning, at one o&rsquo;clock. Then behold! the wand is waved,
      the land of adventures opens before us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to damp your enthusiasm, my Canadian friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
      the sort of adventures you may meet with to-night are scarcely likely to
      fire your romantic nature. I know a little about what they call this
      underneath world in New York. It will probably resolve itself into a visit
      to Chinatown, where we shall find the usual dummies taking opium and quite
      prepared to talk about it for the usual tip. After that we shall visit a
      few low dancing halls, be shown the scene of several murders, and the
      thing is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a cynic,&rdquo; Sogrange declared. &ldquo;You would throw cold water upon any
      enterprise. Anyway, our detective is coming. We must make use of him, for
      I have engaged to pay him twenty-five dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go where you like,&rdquo; Peter assented, &ldquo;so long as we dine on a roof
      garden. This beastly fur coat keeps me in a state of chronic
      perspiration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Sogrange said, consolingly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s most effective. A roof
      garden, by all means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And recollect,&rdquo; Peter insisted, &ldquo;I bar Chinatown. We&rsquo;ve both of us seen
      the real thing, and there&rsquo;s nothing real about what they show you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chinatown is erased from our program,&rdquo; Sogrange agreed. &ldquo;We go now to
      dine. Remind me, Baron, that I inquire for those strange dishes of which
      one hears Terrapin, Canvas-backed Duck, Green Corn, Strawberry Shortcake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How like a Frenchman,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;to take no account of seasons!
      Never mind, Marquis, you shall give your order and I will sketch the
      waiter&rsquo;s face. By the bye, if you&rsquo;re in earnest about this expedition
      to-night, put your revolver into your pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we &lsquo;re going with an ex-detective,&rdquo; Sogrange replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One never knows,&rdquo; Peter said, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They dined close to the stone palisading of one of New York&rsquo;s most famous
      roof gardens. Sogrange ordered an immense dinner but spent most of his
      time gazing downwards. They were higher up than at the hotel and they
      could see across the tangled maze of lights even to the river, across
      which the great ferry-boats were speeding all the while&mdash;huge
      creatures of streaming fire and whistling sirens. The air where they sat
      was pure and crisp. There was no fog, no smoke, to cloud the almost
      crystalline clearness of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baron,&rdquo; Sogrange declared, &ldquo;if I had lived in this city I should have
      been a different man. No wonder the people are all conquering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much electricity in the air for me,&rdquo; Peter answered. &ldquo;I like a little
      repose. I can&rsquo;t think where these people find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hopes,&rdquo; Sogrange murmured, &ldquo;that before they progress any further in
      utilitarianism, they will find some artist, one of themselves, to express
      all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; Peter interrupted, &ldquo;the waiter would like to know what
      we are going to drink. I&rsquo;ve eaten such a confounded jumble of things of
      your ordering that I should like some champagne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who shall say that I am not generous!&rdquo; Sogrange replied, taking up the
      wine carte. &ldquo;Champagne it shall be. We need something to nerve us for our
      adventures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter leaned across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sogrange,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;for the last twenty-four hours I have had some
      doubts as to the success of our little enterprise. It has occurred to me
      more than once that we are being shadowed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes wonder,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;how a man of your suspicious nature
      ever acquired the reputation you undoubtedly enjoy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is because of my suspicious nature,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;There is a
      man staying in our hotel whom we are beginning to see quite a great deal
      of. He was talking to the head porter a few minutes before you this
      afternoon. He supped at the same restaurant last night. He is dining now
      three places behind you to the right, with a young lady who has been
      making flagrant attempts at flirtation with me, notwithstanding my gray
      hairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your reputation, my dear Peter,&rdquo; Sogrange murmured&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a decoy,&rdquo; Peter interrupted, &ldquo;the young lady&rsquo;s methods are too
      vigorous. She pretends to be terribly afraid of her companion, but it is
      entirely obvious that she is acting on his instructions. Of course, this
      may be a ruse of the reporters. On the other hand, I think it would be
      wise to abandon our little expedition to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I am concerned,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am committed to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In which case,&rdquo; Peter replied, &ldquo;I am certainly committed to being your
      companion. The only question is whether one shall fall to the decoy and
      suffer oneself to be led in the direction her companion desires, or
      whether we shall go blundering into trouble on our own account with your
      friend the ex-detective.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange glanced over his shoulder, leaned back in his chair for a moment,
      as though to look at the stars, and finally lit a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a lack of subtlety about that young person, Baron,&rdquo; he declared,
      &ldquo;which stifles one&rsquo;s suspicions. I suspect her to be merely one more
      victim to your undoubted charms. In the interests of Madame your wife, I
      shall take you away. The decoy shall weave her spells in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They paid their bill and departed a few minutes later. The man and the
      girl were also in the act of leaving. The former seemed to be having some
      dispute about the bill. The girl, standing with her back to him, scribbled
      a line upon a piece of paper, and, as Peter went by, pushed it into his
      hand with a little warning gesture. In the lift he opened it. The few
      penciled words contained nothing but an address: Number 15, 100th Street,
      East.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky man!&rdquo; Sogrange sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter made no remark, but he was thoughtful for the next hour or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ex-detective proved to be an individual of fairly obvious appearance,
      whose complexion and thirst indicated a very possible reason for his life
      of leisure. He heard with surprise that his patrons were not inclined to
      visit Chinatown, but he showed a laudable desire to fall in with their
      schemes, provided always that they included a reasonable number of visits
      to places where refreshment could be obtained. From first to last, the
      expedition was a disappointment. They visited various smoke-hung dancing
      halls, decorated for the most part with oleographs and cracked mirrors, in
      which sickly-Looking young men of unwholesome aspect were dancing with
      their feminine counterparts. The attitude of their guide was alone
      amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, you want to be careful in here!&rdquo; he would declare, in an awed tone,
      on entering one of these tawdry palaces. &ldquo;Guess this is one of the
      toughest spots in New York City. You stick close to me and I&rsquo;ll make
      things all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His method of making things all right was the same in every case. He would
      form a circle of disreputable-looking youths, for whose drinks Sogrange
      was called upon to pay. The attitude of these young men was more dejected
      than positively vicious. They showed not the slightest signs of any desire
      to make themselves unpleasant. Only once, when Sogrange incautiously
      displayed a gold watch, did the eyes of one or two of their number
      glisten. The ex-detective changed his place and whispered hoarsely in his
      patron&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t you flash anything of that sort about here! That young cove
      right opposite to you is one of the best known sneak-thieves in the city.
      You&rsquo;re asking for trouble that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he or any other of them want my watch,&rdquo; Sogrange answered calmly, &ldquo;let
      them come and fetch it. However,&rdquo; he added, buttoning up his coat, &ldquo;no
      doubt you are right. Is there anywhere else to take us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t much that you haven&rsquo;t seen,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange laughed softly as he rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sell, my dear friend,&rdquo; he said to Peter. &ldquo;This terrible city keeps its
      real criminal class somewhere else rather than in the show places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man who had been standing in the doorway, looking in for several
      moments, strolled up to them. Peter recognized him at once and touched
      Sogrange on the arm. The newcomer accosted them pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;ll excuse my butting in,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;but I can see you&rsquo;re kind
      of disappointed. These suckers&rdquo;&mdash;indicating the ex-detective&mdash;&ldquo;talk
      a lot about what they&rsquo;re going to show you, and when they get you round it
      all amounts to nothing. This is the sort of thing they bring you to, as
      representing the wickedness of New York! That&rsquo;s so, Rastall, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ex-detective looked a little sheepish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there ain&rsquo;t much more to be seen,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll take
      the job on if you think there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d show the gentlemen something of a sight more interesting that
      this,&rdquo; the newcomer continued. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to sit down and drink with
      the scum of the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Sogrange suggested, &ldquo;this gentleman has something in his mind
      which he thinks would appeal to us. We have a motor car outside and we are
      out for adventures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of adventures?&rdquo; the newcomer asked, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange shrugged his shoulders lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are lookers-on merely,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;My friend and I have traveled a
      good deal. We have seen something of criminal life in Paris and London,
      Vienna and Budapest. I shall not break any confidence if I tell you that
      my friend is a writer, and material such as this is useful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The newcomer smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;in a way, it&rsquo;s fortunate for you that I happened
      along! You come right with me and I&rsquo;ll show you something that very few
      other people in this city know of. Guess you&rsquo;d better pay this fellow
      off,&rdquo; he added, indicating the ex-detective. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no more use to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange and Peter exchanged questioning glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very kind of you, sir,&rdquo; Peter decided, &ldquo;but for my part I have had
      enough for one evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you like, of course,&rdquo; the other remarked, with studied unconcern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of place would it be?&rdquo; Sogrange asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newcomer drew them on one side, although, as a matter of fact, every
      one else had already melted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever heard of the Secret Societies of New York?&rdquo; he inquired.
      &ldquo;Well, I guess you haven&rsquo;t, any way&mdash;not to know anything about them.
      Well, then, listen. There&rsquo;s a Society meets within a few steps of here,
      which has more to do with regulating the criminal classes of the city than
      any police establishment. There&rsquo;ll be a man there within an hour or so,
      who, to my knowledge, has committed seven murders. The police can&rsquo;t get
      him. They never will. He&rsquo;s under our protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May we visit such a place as you describe without danger?&rdquo; Peter asked,
      calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s danger in going anywhere, it seems to me,
      if it&rsquo;s worth while. So long as you keep a still tongue in your head and
      don&rsquo;t look about you too much, there&rsquo;s nothing will happen to you. If you
      get gassing a lot, you might tumble in for almost anything. Don&rsquo;t come
      unless you like. It&rsquo;s a chance for your friend, as he&rsquo;s a writer, but
      you&rsquo;d best keep out of it if you&rsquo;re in any way nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said it was quite close?&rdquo; Sogrange inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within a yard or two,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s right this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They left the hall with their new escort. When they looked for their motor
      car, they found it had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t do to keep them things waiting about round here,&rdquo; their new
      friend remarked, carelessly. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll send you back to your hotel all
      right. Step this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye, what street is this we are in?&rdquo; Peter asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;100th Street,&rdquo; the man answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little superstitious about that number,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Is that an
      elevated railway there? I think we&rsquo;ve had enough, Sogrange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange hesitated. They were standing now in front of a tall gloomy
      house, unkempt, with broken gate&mdash;a large but miserable-looking
      abode. The passers-by in the street were few. The whole character of the
      surroundings was squalid. The man pushed open the broken gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cross the street right there to the elevated,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;If you
      ain&rsquo;t coming, I&rsquo;ll bid you good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more they hesitated. Peter, perhaps, saw more than his companion. He
      saw the dark shapes lurking under the railway arch. He knew instinctively
      that they were in some sort of danger. And yet the love of adventure was
      on fire in his blood. His belief in himself was immense. He whispered to
      Sogrange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not trust our guide,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you care to risk it, I am with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind the broken pavement,&rdquo; the man called out. &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t exactly an
      abode of luxury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They climbed some broken steps. Their guide opened a door with a Yale key.
      The door swung to, after them, and they found themselves in darkness.
      There had been no light in the windows; there was no light, apparently, in
      the house. Their companion produced an electric torch from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had best follow me,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;Our quarters face out the other
      way. We keep this end looking a little deserted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed through a swing door and everything was at once changed. A
      multitude of lamps hung from the ceiling, the floor was carpeted, the
      walls clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t go in for electric light,&rdquo; their guide explained, &ldquo;as we try not
      to give the place away. We manage to keep it fairly comfortable, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed open the door and entered a somewhat gorgeously furnished salon.
      There were signs here of feminine occupation, an open piano, and the smell
      of cigarettes. Once more Peter hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friends seem to be in hiding,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Personally, I am losing
      my curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you won&rsquo;t have to wait very long,&rdquo; the man replied, with meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was suddenly invaded on all sides. Four doors, which were quite
      hidden by the pattern of the wall, had opened almost simultaneously, and
      at least a dozen men had entered. This time both Sogrange and Peter knew
      that they were face to face with the real thing. These were men who came
      silently in, no cigarette-stunted youths. Two of them were in evening
      dress; three or four had the appearance of prize fighters. In their
      countenances was one expression common to all&mdash;an air of quiet and
      conscious strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fair-headed man, in dinner jacket and black tie, became at once their
      spokesman. He was possessed of a very slight American accent, and he
      beamed at them through a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am glad to meet you both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very kind of you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Sogrange answered. &ldquo;Our friend here,&rdquo; he
      added, indicating their guide, &ldquo;found us trying to gain a little insight
      into the more interesting part of New York life. He was kind enough to
      express a wish to introduce us to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man smiled. He looked very much like some studious clerk, except that
      his voice seemed to ring with some latent power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that your friend&rsquo;s interest in you was not
      entirely unselfish. For three days he has carried in his pocket an order
      instructing him to produce you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; Peter whispered, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You interest me,&rdquo; Sogrange replied. &ldquo;May I know whom I have the honor of
      addressing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can call me Burr,&rdquo; the man announced, &ldquo;Philip Burr. Your names it is
      not our wish to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I do not quite understand,&rdquo; Sogrange said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was scarcely to be expected that you should,&rdquo; Mr. Philip Burr
      admitted. &ldquo;All I can tell you is that, in cases like yours, I really
      prefer not to know with whom I have to deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as though you had business with us,&rdquo; Peter remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt, I have,&rdquo; the other replied, grimly. &ldquo;It is my business to
      see that you do not leave these premises alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange drew up a chair against which he had been leaning, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that would be most inconvenient.&rdquo; Peter, too, shook
      his head, sitting upon the end of a sofa and folding his arms. Something
      told him that the moment for fighting was not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inconvenient or not,&rdquo; Mr. Philip Burr continued, &ldquo;I have orders to carry
      out which I can assure you have never yet been disobeyed since the
      formation of our Society. From what I can see of you, you appear to be
      very amiable gentlemen, and if it would interest you to choose the method&mdash;say,
      of your release&mdash;why, I can assure you we&rsquo;ll do all we can to meet
      your views.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am beginning,&rdquo; Sogrange remarked, &ldquo;to feel quite at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, we&rsquo;ve been through this sort of thing before,&rdquo; Peter added,
      blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Philip Burr took a cigar from his case and lit it. At a motion of his
      hand, one of the company passed the box to his two guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not counting upon a visit from the police, or anything of that
      sort, I hope?&rdquo; Mr. Philip Burr asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I may say that much of the earlier portion
      of my life was spent in frustrating the well-meant but impossible schemes
      of that body of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only we had a little more time,&rdquo; Mr. Burr declared, &ldquo;it seems to me I
      should like to make the acquaintance of you two gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is entirely in your own hands,&rdquo; Peter reminded him. &ldquo;We are in
      no hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burr smiled genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me think better of humanity,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;A month ago we had
      a man here&mdash;got him along somehow or another&mdash;and I had to tell
      him that he was up against it like you two are. My! the fuss he made! Kind
      of saddened me to think a man should be such a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people like that,&rdquo; Sogrange remarked. &ldquo;By the bye, Mr. Burr, you&rsquo;ll
      pardon my curiosity. Whom have we to thank for our introduction here
      to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as there&rsquo;s any particular harm in telling you,&rdquo; Mr. Burr
      replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor any particular good,&rdquo; a man who was standing by his side interrupted.
      &ldquo;Say, Phil, you drag these things out too much. Are there any questions
      you&rsquo;ve got to ask &lsquo;em, or any property to collect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; Mr. Burr admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let the gang get to work,&rdquo; the other declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men were suddenly conscious that they were being surrounded.
      Peter&rsquo;s hand stole on to the butt of his revolver. Sogrange rose slowly to
      his feet. His hands were thrust out in front of him with the thumbs turned
      down. The four fingers of each hand flashed for a minute through the air.
      Mr. Philip Burr lost all his self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, where the devil did you learn that trick?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange laughed scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trick!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Philip Burr, you are unworthy of your position. I
      am the Marquis de Sogrange, and my friend here is the Baron de Grost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Philip Burr had no words. His cigar had dropped on to the carpet. He
      was simply staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you need proof,&rdquo; Sogrange continued, &ldquo;further than any I have given
      you, I have in my pocket, at the present moment, a letter, signed by you
      yourself, pleading for formal reinstatement. This is how you would qualify
      for it! You make use of your power to run a common decoy house, to do away
      with men for money. What fool gave you our names, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Philip Burr was only the wreck of a man. He could not even control his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was some German or Belgian nobleman,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;He brought us
      excellent letters, and he made a large contribution. It was the Count von
      Hern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The anger of Sogrange seemed suddenly to fade away. He threw himself into
      a chair by the side of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Baron,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;Bernadine has scored, indeed! Your friend
      has a sense of humor which overwhelms me. Imagine it. He has delivered the
      two heads of our great Society into the hands of one of its cast-off
      branches! Bernadine is a genius, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Philip Burr began slowly to recover himself. He waved his hand. Nine
      out of the twelve men left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marquis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for ten years there has been no one whom I have
      desired to meet so much as you. I came to Europe but you declined to
      receive me. I know very well we can&rsquo;t keep our end up like you over there,
      because we haven&rsquo;t politics and that sort of things to play with, but
      we&rsquo;ve done our best. We&rsquo;ve encouraged only criminology of the highest
      order. We&rsquo;ve tried all we can to keep the profession select. The
      jail-bird, pure and simple, we have cast out. The men who have suffered at
      our hands have been men who have met with their deserts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about us?&rdquo; Peter demanded. &ldquo;It seems to me that you had most
      unpleasant plans for our future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip Burr held up his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I live,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;this is the first time that any money
      consideration has induced me to break away from our principles. That Count
      von Hern, he had powerful friends who were our friends, and he gave me the
      word, straight, that you two had an appointment down below which was
      considerably overdue. I don&rsquo;t know, even now, why I consented. I guess it
      isn&rsquo;t much use apologizing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not inclined to bear malice, but you must
      understand this from me, Philip Burr. As a Society, I dissolve you. I
      deprive you of your title and of your signs. Call yourself what you will,
      but never again mention the name of the &lsquo;Double-Four.&rsquo; With us in Europe,
      another era has dawned. We are on the side of law and order. We protect
      only criminals of a certain class, in whose operations we have faith.
      There is no future for such a society in this country. Therefore, as I
      say, I dissolve it. Now, if you are ready, perhaps you will be so good as
      to provide us with the means of reaching our hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip Burr led them into a back street, where his own handsome automobile
      was placed at their service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This kind of breaks me all up,&rdquo; he declared, as he gave the instructions
      to the chauffeur. &ldquo;If there were two men on the face of this earth whom
      I&rsquo;d have been proud to meet in a friendly sort of way, it&rsquo;s you two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We bear no malice, Mr. Burr,&rdquo; Sogrange assured him. &ldquo;You can, if you will
      do us the honor, lunch with us to-morrow at one o&rsquo;clock at Rector&rsquo;s. My
      friend here is quite interested in the Count von Hern, and he would
      probably like to hear exactly how this affair was arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there, sure,&rdquo; Philip Burr promised, with a farewell wave of the
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange and Peter drove back towards their hotel in silence. It was only
      when they emerged into the civilized part of the city that Sogrange began
      to laugh softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;you bluffed fairly well, but you were afraid.
      Oh, how I smiled to see your fingers close round the butt of that
      revolver!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; Peter asked, gruffly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose you took me in,
      do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had two reasons for coming to New York,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One we accomplished
      upon the steamer. The other was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To reply personally to this letter of Mr. Philip Burr,&rdquo; Sogrange replied,
      &ldquo;which letter, by the bye, was dated from 15, 100th Street, New York. An
      ordinary visit there would have been useless to me. Something of this sort
      was necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you knew!&rdquo; Peter gasped. &ldquo;Notwithstanding all your bravado, you
      knew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a very fair idea,&rdquo; Sogrange admitted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be annoyed with me, my
      friend. You have had a little experience. It is all useful. It isn&rsquo;t the
      first time you&rsquo;ve looked death in the face. Adventures come to some men
      unasked. You, I think, were born with the habit of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter smiled. They had reached the hotel courtyard and he raised himself
      stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little fable about the pitcher that went once too often to the
      well,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I have had my share of luck&mdash;more than my share.
      The end must come sometime, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this superstition?&rdquo; Sogrange asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Superstition, pure and simple,&rdquo; Peter confessed, taking his key from the
      office. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t alter anything. I am fatalist enough to shrug my
      shoulders and move on. But I tell you, Sogrange,&rdquo; he added, after a
      moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t admit it to any one else in the world, but I
      am afraid of Bernadine. I have had the best of it so often. It can&rsquo;t last.
      In all we&rsquo;ve had twelve encounters. The next will be the thirteenth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange shrugged his shoulders slightly as he rang for the lift.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d propose you for the Thirteen Club, only there&rsquo;s some uncomfortable
      clause about yearly suicides which might not suit you,&rdquo; he remarked.
      &ldquo;Good-night, and don&rsquo;t dream of Bernadine and your thirteenth encounter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only hope,&rdquo; Peter murmured, &ldquo;that I may be in a position to dream after
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE THIRTEENTH ENCOUNTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Marquis de Sogrange arrived in Berkeley Square with the gray dawn of
      an October morning, showing in his appearance and dress few enough signs
      of his night journey. Yet he had traveled without stopping from Paris, by
      fast motor car and the mail boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They telephoned me from Charing Cross,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;that you could not
      possibly arrive until midday. The clerk assured me that no train had yet
      reached Calais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had reason in what they told you,&rdquo; Sogrange remarked, as he leaned
      back in a chair and sipped the coffee which had been waiting for him in
      the Baron de Grost&rsquo;s study. &ldquo;The train itself never got more than a mile
      away from the Gare du Nord. The engine-driver was shot through the head
      and the metals were torn from the way. Paris is within a year now of a
      second and more terrible revolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really believe this?&rdquo; Peter asked, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a certainty,&rdquo; Sogrange replied. &ldquo;Not I alone but many others can
      see this clearly. Everywhere the Socialists have wormed themselves into
      places of trust. They are to be met with in every rank of life, under
      every form of disguise. The post-office strike has already shown us what
      deplorable disasters even a skirmish can bring about. To-day the railway
      strike has paralyzed France. To-day our country lies absolutely at the
      mercy of any invader. As it happens, none is, for the moment, prepared.
      Who can tell how it may be next time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is had news,&rdquo; Peter declared. &ldquo;If this is really the position of
      affairs, the matter is much more serious than the newspapers would have us
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The newspapers,&rdquo; Sogrange muttered, &ldquo;ignore what lies behind. Some of
      them, I think, are paid to do it. As for the rest, our Press had always an
      ostrich-like tendency. The Frenchman of the cafe does not buy his journal
      to be made sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe, then,&rdquo; Peter asked, &ldquo;that these strikes have some definite
      tendency?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange set down his cup and smiled bitterly. In the early sunlight,
      still a little cold and unloving, Peter could see that there was a change
      in the man. He was no longer the debonair aristocrat of the race-courses
      and the boulevards. The shadows under his eyes were deeper, his cheeks
      more sunken. He had lost something of the sprightliness of his bearing.
      His attitude, indeed, was almost dejected. He was like a man who sees into
      the future and finds there strange and gruesome things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do more than believe that,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I know it. It has fallen to
      my lot to make a very definite discovery concerning them. Listen, my
      friend. For more than six months the government has been trying to
      discover the source of this stream of vile socialistic literature which
      has contaminated the French working classes. The pamphlets have been
      distributed with devilish ingenuity among all national operatives, the
      army and the navy. The government has failed. The Double-Four has
      succeeded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have really discovered their source?&rdquo; Peter exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt,&rdquo; Sogrange assented. &ldquo;The government appealed to us first
      some months ago when I was in America. For a time we had no success. Then
      a clue, and the rest was easy. The navy, the army, the post-office
      employees, the telegraph and telephone operators and the railway men, have
      been the chief recipients of this incessant stream of foul literature.
      To-day one cannot tell how much mischief has been actually done. The
      strikes which have already occurred are only the mutterings of the coming
      storm. But mark you, wherever those pamphlets have gone, trouble has
      followed. What men may do the government is doing, but all the time the
      poison is at work, the seed has been sown. Two millions of money have been
      spent to corrupt that very class which should be the backbone of France.
      Through the fingers of one man has come this shower of gold, one man alone
      has stood at the head of the great organization which has disseminated
      this loathsome disease. Behind him&mdash;well, we know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fitting that you should ask that question,&rdquo; Sogrange replied. &ldquo;The
      name of that man is Bernadine, Count von Hern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter remained speechless. There was something almost terrible in the slow
      preciseness with which Sogrange had uttered the name of his enemy,
      something unspeakably threatening in the cold glitter of his angry eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to the present,&rdquo; Sogrange continued, &ldquo;I have watched&mdash;sympathetically,
      of course, but with a certain amount of amusement&mdash;the duel between
      you and Bernadine. It has been against your country and your country&rsquo;s
      welfare that most of his efforts have been directed, which perhaps
      accounts for the equanimity with which I have been contented to remain a
      looker-on. It is apparent, my dear Baron, that in most of your encounters
      the honors have remained with you. Yet, as it has chanced, never once has
      Bernadine been struck a real and crushing blow. The time has come when
      this and more must happen. It is no longer a matter of polite exchanges.
      It is a duel a outrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; Peter began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that Bernadine must die,&rdquo; Sogrange declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief silence. Outside, the early morning street noises were
      increasing in volume as the great army of workers, streaming towards the
      heart of the city from a hundred suburbs, passed on to their tasks. A
      streak of sunshine had found its way into the room, lay across the carpet
      and touched Sogrange&rsquo;s still, waxen features. Peter glanced half fearfully
      at his friend and visitor. He himself was no coward, no shrinker from the
      great issues. He, too, had dealt in life and death. Yet there was
      something in the deliberate preciseness of Sogrange&rsquo;s words, as he sat
      there only a few feet away, unspeakably thrilling. It was like a death
      sentence pronounced in all solemnity upon some shivering criminal. There
      was something inevitable and tragical about the whole affair. A
      pronouncement had been made from which there was no appeal&mdash;Bernadine
      was to die!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a little exceeding the usual exercise of our powers?&rdquo; Peter
      asked, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such occasion as this has ever yet arisen,&rdquo; Sogrange reminded him.
      &ldquo;Bernadine has fled to this country with barely an hour to spare. His
      offense is extraditable by a law of the last century which has never been
      repealed. He is guilty of treason against the Republic of France. Yet they
      do not want him back, they do not want a trial. I have papers upon my
      person which, if I took them into an English court, would procure for me a
      warrant for Bernadine&rsquo;s arrest. It is not this we desire. Bernadine must
      die. No fate could be too terrible for a man who has striven to corrupt
      the soul of a nation. It is not war, this. It is not honest conspiracy. Is
      it war, I ask you, to seek to poison the drinking water of an enemy, to
      send stalking into their midst some loathsome disease? Such things belong
      to the ages of barbarity. Bernadine has striven to revive them and
      Bernadine shall die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is justice,&rdquo; Peter admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question remains,&rdquo; Sogrange continued, &ldquo;by whose hand&mdash;yours or
      mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter started uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that necessary?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that it is,&rdquo; Sogrange replied. &ldquo;We had a brief meeting of the
      executive council last night, and it was decided, for certain reasons, to
      entrust this task into no other hands. You will smile when I tell you that
      these accursed pamphlets have found their way into the possession of many
      of the rank and file of our own order. There is a marked disinclination on
      the part of those who have been our slaves, to accept orders from any one.
      Espionage we can still command&mdash;the best, perhaps, in Europe&mdash;because
      here we use a different class of material. But of those underneath, we
      are, for the moment, doubtful. Paris is all in a ferment. Under its
      outward seemliness a million throats are ready to take up the brazen cry
      of revolution. One trusts nobody. One fears all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You or I!&rdquo; Peter repeated, slowly. &ldquo;It will not be sufficient, then, that
      we find Bernadine and deliver him over to your country&rsquo;s laws?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not be sufficient,&rdquo; Sogrange answered, sternly. &ldquo;From those he
      may escape. For him there must be no escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sogrange,&rdquo; Peter said, speaking in a low tone, &ldquo;I have never yet killed a
      human being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; Sogrange admitted. &ldquo;Nor have I yet set my heel upon its head and
      stamped the life from a rat upon the pavement. But one lives and one moves
      on. Bernadine is the enemy of your country and mine. He makes war after
      the fashion of vermin. No ordinary cut-throat would succeed against him.
      It must be you or I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall we decide?&rdquo; Peter asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spin of a coin,&rdquo; Sogrange replied. &ldquo;It is best that way. It is best,
      too, done quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter produced a sovereign from his pocket and balanced it on the palm of
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be understood,&rdquo; Sogrange continued, &ldquo;that this is a dual
      undertaking. We toss only for the final honor&mdash;for the last stroke.
      If the choice falls upon me, I shall count upon you to help me to the end.
      If it falls upon you, I shall be at your right hand even when you strike
      the blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is agreed,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;See, it is for you to call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw the coin high into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call heads,&rdquo; Sogrange decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fell upon the table. Peter covered it with his hand and then slowly
      withdrew the fingers. A little shiver ran through his veins. The harmless
      head that looked up at him was like the figure of death. It was for him to
      strike the blow!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Bernadine now?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me a morning paper and I will tell you,&rdquo; Sogrange declared, rising.
      &ldquo;He was in the train which was stopped outside the Gare du Nord, on his
      way to England. What became of the passengers I have not heard. I knew
      what was likely to happen, and I left an hour before in a 100 H. P.
      Charron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter rang the bell and ordered the servant who answered it to procure the
      Daily Telegraph. As soon as it arrived, he spread it open upon the table
      and Sogrange looked over his shoulder. These are the headings which they
      saw in large black characters:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     RENEWED RIOTS IN PARIS

                  THE GARE DU NORD IN FLAMES

         TERRIBLE ACCIDENT TO THE CALAIS-DOUVRES EXPRESS

                         MANY DEATHS
</pre>
    <p>
      Peter&rsquo;s forefinger traveled down the page swiftly. It paused at the
      following paragraph:
    </p>
    <p>
      The 8.55 train from the Gare du Nord, carrying many passengers for London,
      after being detained within a mile of Paris for over an hour owing to the
      murder of the engine-driver, made an attempt last night to proceed, with
      terrible results. Near Chantilly, whilst travelling at over fifty miles an
      hour, the switches were tampered with and the express dashed into a goods
      train laden with minerals. Very few particulars are yet to hand, but the
      express was completely wrecked and many lives have been lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the dead are the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one Peter read out the names. Then he stopped short. A little
      exclamation broke from Sogrange&rsquo;s lips. The thirteenth name upon that list
      of dead was that of Bernadine, Count von Hern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bernadine!&rdquo; Peter faltered. &ldquo;Bernadine is dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killed by the strikers!&rdquo; Sogrange echoed! &ldquo;It is a just thing, this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked down at the paper and then up at one another. A strange
      silence seemed to have found its way into the room. The shadow of death
      lay between them. Peter touched his forehead and found it wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a just thing, indeed,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;but justice and death are
      alike terrible.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon of the same day, a motor car, splashed with mud,
      drew up before the door of the house in Berkeley Square. Sogrange, who was
      standing talking to Peter before the library window, suddenly broke off in
      the middle of a sentence. He stepped back into the room and gripped his
      friend&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Baroness!&rdquo; he exclaimed, quickly. &ldquo;What does she want here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baroness who? Peter demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baroness von Ratten. You must have heard of her&mdash;she is the
      friend of Bernadine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men had been out to lunch at the Ritz with Violet and had walked
      across the Park home. Sogrange had been drawing on his gloves in the act
      of starting out for a call at the Embassy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your wife know this woman?&rdquo; he asked. Peter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she has come to see you,&rdquo; Sogrange continued. &ldquo;What does it mean, I
      wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall know in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door and his servant entered, bearing a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lady would like to see you, sir, on important business,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can show her in here,&rdquo; Peter directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a very short delay. The two men had no time to exchange a word.
      They heard the rustling of a woman&rsquo;s gown, and immediately afterwards the
      perfume of violets seemed to fill the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baroness von Ratten!&rdquo; the butler announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was closed behind her. The servant had disappeared. Peter
      advanced to meet his guest. She was a little above medium height, very
      slim, with extraordinarily fair hair, colorless face, and strange eyes.
      She was not strictly beautiful and yet there was no man upon whom her
      presence was without its effect. Her voice was like her movements, slow
      and with a grace of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not mind that I have come to see you?&rdquo; she asked, raising her eyes
      to Peter&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I believe before I go that you will think terrible things of
      me, but you must not begin before I have told you my errand. It has been a
      great struggle with me before I made up my mind to come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down, Baroness?&rdquo; Peter invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw Sogrange and hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not alone,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;I wish to speak with you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to present to you the Marquis de Sogrange,&rdquo; Peter begged. &ldquo;He
      is my oldest friend, Baroness. I think that whatever you might have to say
      to me you might very well say before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;of a private nature,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marquis and I have no secrets,&rdquo; Peter declared, &ldquo;either political or
      private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down and motioned Peter to take a place by her side upon the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will forgive me if I am a little incoherent,&rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;To-day I
      have had a shock. You, too, have read the news? You must know that the
      Count von Hern is dead&mdash;killed in the railway accident last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We read it in the Daily Telegraph,&rdquo; Peter replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in all the papers,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You know that he was a very
      dear friend of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard so,&rdquo; Peter admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet there was one subject,&rdquo; she insisted, earnestly, &ldquo;upon which we never
      agreed. He hated England. I have always loved it. England was kind to me
      when my own country drove me out. I have always felt grateful. It has been
      a sorrow to me that in so many of his schemes, in so much of his work,
      Bernadine should consider his own country at the expense of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange drew a little nearer. It began to be interesting, this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard the news early this morning by telegram,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;For a
      long time I was prostrated. Then early this afternoon I began to think&mdash;one
      must always think. Bernadine was a dear friend, but things between us
      lately have been different, a little strained. Was it his fault or mine&mdash;who
      can say? Does one tire with the years, I wonder? I wonder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were lifted to his and Peter was conscious of the fact that she
      wished him to know that they were beautiful. She looked slowly away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This afternoon, as I sat alone,&rdquo; she proceeded, &ldquo;I remembered that in my
      keeping were many boxes of papers and many letters which have recently
      arrived, all belonging to Bernadine. I reflected that there were certainly
      some who were in his confidence, and that very soon they would come from
      his country and take them all away. And then I remembered what I owed to
      England, and how opposed I always was to Bernadine&rsquo;s schemes, and I
      thought that the best thing I could do to show my gratitude would be to
      place his papers all in the hands of some Englishman, so that they might
      do no more harm to the country which has been kind to me. So I came to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again her eyes were lifted to his and Peter was very sure indeed that they
      were wonderfully beautiful. He began to realize the fascination of this
      woman, of whom he had heard so much. Her very absence of coloring was a
      charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that you have brought me these papers?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I could not do that. There were too many of them&mdash;they
      are too heavy, and there are piles of pamphlets&mdash;revolutionary
      pamphlets, I am afraid&mdash;all in French, which I do not understand. No,
      I could not bring them to you. But I ordered my motor car and I drove up
      here to tell you that if you like to come down to the house in the country
      where I have been living, to which Bernadine was to have come to-night&mdash;yes,
      and bring your friend, too, if you will&mdash;you shall look through them
      before any one else can arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; Peter murmured. &ldquo;Tell me where it is that you live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is beyond Hitchin,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;up the Great North Road. I tell you
      at once, it is a horrible house in a horrible lonely spot. Within a day or
      two I shall leave it myself forever. I hate it&mdash;it gets on my nerves.
      I dream of all the terrible things which perhaps have taken place there.
      Who can tell? It was Bernadine&rsquo;s long before I came to England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are we to come?&rdquo; Peter asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come back with me now, at once,&rdquo; the Baroness insisted. &ldquo;I
      cannot tell how soon some one in his confidence may arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will order my car,&rdquo; Peter declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind coming in mine?&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;It is of no consequence, if you
      object, but every servant in Bernadine&rsquo;s house is a German and a spy.
      There are no women except my own maid. Your car is likely enough known to
      them and there might be trouble. If you will come with me now, you and
      your friend, if you like, I will send you to the station to-night in time
      to catch the train home. I feel that I must have this thing off my mind.
      You will come? Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter rang the bell and ordered his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a doubt,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;May we not offer you some tea first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day I cannot think of eating or drinking,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Bernadine and
      I were no longer what we had been, but the shock of his death seems none
      the less terrible. I feel like a traitor to him for coming here, yet I
      believe that I am doing what is right,&rdquo; she added, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will excuse me for one moment,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;while I take leave of
      my wife, I will rejoin you presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was absent for only a few minutes. Sogrange and the Baroness
      exchanged the merest commonplaces. As they all passed down the hall,
      Sogrange lingered behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will take the Baroness out to the car,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;I will
      telephone to the Embassy and tell them not to expect me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter offered his arm to his companion. She seemed, indeed, to need
      support. Her fingers clutched at his coat-sleeve as they passed on to the
      pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad to be no longer quite alone,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Almost I wish
      that your friend were not coming. I know that Bernadine and you were
      enemies, but then you were enemies not personally, but politically. After
      all, it is you who stand for the things which have become so dear to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that Bernadine and I were bitter antagonists,&rdquo; Peter admitted,
      gravely. &ldquo;Death, however, ends all that. I wish him no further harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am growing used to being friendless. I was
      friendless before Bernadine came, and latterly we have been nothing to one
      another. Now, I suppose, I shall know what it is to be an outcast once
      more. Did you ever hear my history, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, Baroness,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I understood, I believe, that your
      marriage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband divorced me,&rdquo; she confessed, simply. &ldquo;He was quite within his
      rights. He was impossible. I was very young and very sentimental. They say
      that Englishwomen are cold,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Perhaps that is so. People think
      that I look cold. Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange suddenly opened the door of the car in which they were already
      seated. She leaned back and half closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather a long ride,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I am worn out. I hope you will
      not mind, but for myself I cannot talk when motoring. Smoke, if it pleases
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might one inquire as to our exact destination?&rdquo; Sogrange asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We go beyond Hitchin, up the Great North Road,&rdquo; she told him again. &ldquo;The
      house is called the High House. It stands in the middle of a heath and I
      think it is the loneliest and most miserable place that was ever built. I
      hate it and I am frightened in it. For some reason or other, it suited
      Bernadine, but that is all over now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little party of three relapsed into silence. The car, driven carefully
      enough through the busy streets, gradually increased its pace as they drew
      clear of the suburbs. Peter leaned back in his place, thinking. Bernadine
      was dead! Nothing else would have convinced him so utterly of the fact as
      that simple sentence in the Daily Telegraph, which had been followed up by
      a confirmation and a brief obituary notice in all the evening papers.
      Curiously enough, the fact seemed to have drawn a certain spice out of
      even this adventure; to point, indeed, to a certain monotony in the
      future. Their present enterprise, important though it might turn out to
      be, was nothing to be proud of. A woman, greedy for gold, was selling her
      lover&rsquo;s secrets before the breath was out of his body. Peter turned in his
      cushioned seat to look at her. Without doubt, she was beautiful to one who
      understood, beautiful in a strange, colorless, feline fashion, the beauty
      of soft limbs, soft movements, a caressing voice, with always the promise
      beyond of more than the actual words. Her eyes now were closed, her face
      was a little weary. Did she really rest, Peter wondered? He watched the
      rising and falling of her bosom, the quivering now and then of her
      eyelids. She had indeed the appearance of a woman who had suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car rushed on into the darkness. Behind them lay that restless
      phantasmagoria of lights streaming to the sky. In front, blank space.
      Peter, through half-closed eyes, watched the woman by his side. From the
      moment of her entrance into his library, he had summed her up in his mind
      with a single word. She was, beyond a doubt, an adventuress. No woman
      could have proposed the things which she had proposed, who was not of that
      ilk. Yet for that reason it behooved them to have a care in their dealings
      with her. At her instigation they had set out upon this adventure, which
      might well turn out according to any fashion that she chose. Yet without
      Bernadine what could she do? She was not the woman to carry on the work
      which he had left behind, for the love of him. Her words had been frank,
      her action shameful but natural. Bernadine was dead and she had realized
      quickly enough the best market for his secrets. In a few days&rsquo; time his
      friends would have come and she would have received nothing. He told
      himself that he was foolish to doubt her. There was not a flaw in the
      sequence of events, no possible reason for the suspicions which yet
      lingered at the back of his brain. Intrigue, it was certain, was to her as
      the breath of her body. He was perfectly willing to believe that the death
      of Bernadine would have affected her little more than the sweeping aside
      of a fly. His very common sense bade him accept her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees he became drowsy. Suddenly he was startled into a very
      wide-awake state. Through half-closed eyes he had seen Sogrange draw a
      sheet of paper from his pocket, a gold pencil from his chain, and commence
      to write. In the middle of a sentence, his eyes were abruptly lifted. He
      was looking at the Baroness. Peter, too, turned his head; he, also, looked
      at the Baroness. Without a doubt, she had been watching both of them.
      Sogrange&rsquo;s pencil continued its task, only he traced no more characters.
      Instead, he seemed to be sketching a face, which presently he tore
      carefully up into small pieces and destroyed. He did not even glance
      towards Peter, but Peter understood very well what had happened. He had
      been about to send him a message, but had found the Baroness watching.
      Peter was fully awake now. His faint sense of suspicion had deepened into
      a positive foreboding. He had a reckless desire to stop the car, to
      descend upon the road and let the secrets of Bernadine go where they
      would. Then his natural love of adventure blazed up once more. His moment
      of weakness had passed. The thrill was in his blood, his nerves were
      tightened. He was ready for what might come, seemingly still half asleep,
      yet, indeed, with every sense of intuition and observation keenly alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange leaned over from his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a lonely country, this, into which we are coming, madame,&rdquo; he
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, it is not so lonely here as you will think it when we arrive at
      our destination,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;There are houses here, but they are hidden
      by the trees. There are no houses near us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rubbed the pane with her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are, I believe, very nearly there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is the nearest
      village. Afterwards, we just climb a hill and about half a mile along the
      top of it is the High House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the name of the village,&rdquo; Sogrange inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St Mary&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;In the summer people call it beautiful around
      here. To me it is the most melancholy spot I ever saw. There is so much
      rain, and one hears the drip, drip in the trees all the day long. Alone I
      could not bear it. To-morrow or the next day I shall pack up my belongings
      and come to London. I am, unfortunately,&rdquo; she added, with a little sigh,
      &ldquo;very, very poor, but it is my hope that you may find the papers, of which
      I have spoken to you, valuable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange smiled faintly. Peter and he could scarcely forbear to exchange a
      single glance. The woman&rsquo;s candor was almost brutal. She read their
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ascend the hill,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;We draw now very near to the end of
      our journey. There is still one thing I would say to you. Do not think too
      badly of me for what I am about to do. To Bernadine, while he lived, I was
      faithful. Many a time I could have told you of his plans and demanded a
      great sum of money, and you would have given it me willingly, but my lips
      were sealed because, in a way, I loved him. While he lived I gave him what
      I owed. To-day he is dead, and, whatever I do, it cannot concern him any
      more. To-day I am a free woman and I take the side I choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear madame,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;what you have proposed to us is, after all,
      quite natural and very gracious. If one has a fear at all about the
      matter, it is as to the importance of these documents you speak of.
      Bernadine, I know, has dealt in great affairs; but he was a diplomat by
      instinct, experienced and calculating. One does not keep incriminating
      papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned a little forward. The car had swung round a corner now and was
      making its way up an avenue as dark as pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wisest of us, Monsieur le Marquis,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;reckon sometimes
      without that one element of sudden death. What should you say, I wonder,
      to a list of agents in France pledged to circulate in certain places
      literature of an infamous sort? What should you say, monsieur, to a copy
      of a secret report of your late maneuvers, franked with the name of one of
      your own staff officers? What should you say,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;to a list of
      Socialist deputies with amounts against their name, amounts paid in hard
      cash? Are these of no importance to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; Sogrange answered, simply, &ldquo;for such information, if it were
      genuine, it would be hard to mention a price which we should not be
      prepared to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The car came to a sudden standstill. The first impression of the two men
      was that the Baroness had exaggerated the loneliness and desolation of the
      place. There was nothing mysterious or forbidding about the plain,
      brownstone house before which they had stopped. The windows were streaming
      with light; the hall door, already thrown open, disclosed a very
      comfortable hall, brilliantly illuminated. A man-servant assisted his
      mistress to alight, another ushered them in. In the background were other
      servants. The Baroness glanced at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About dinner, Carl?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It waits for madame,&rdquo; the man answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care of these gentlemen till I descend,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;You will not
      mind?&rdquo; she added, turning pleadingly to Sogrange. &ldquo;To-day I have eaten
      nothing. I am faint with hunger. Afterwards, it will be a matter but of
      half an hour. You can be in London again by ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will, madame,&rdquo; Sogrange replied. &ldquo;We are greatly indebted to you
      for your hospitality. But for costume, you understand that we are as we
      are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly understood,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;For myself, I rejoin you
      in ten minutes. A loose gown, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange and Peter were shown into a modern bathroom by a servant who was
      so anxious to wait upon them that they had difficulty in sending him away.
      As soon as he was gone and the door closed behind him, Peter put his foot
      against it and turned the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were going to write something to me in the car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a moment,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;when I had a suspicion. It has passed.
      This woman is no Roman. She sells the secrets of Bernadine as she would
      sell herself. Nevertheless, it is well always to be prepared. There were
      probably others beside Bernadine who had the entree here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only suspicious circumstance which I have noticed,&rdquo; Peter remarked,
      &ldquo;is the number of men-servants. I have seen five already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only fair to remember,&rdquo; Sogrange reminded him, &ldquo;that the Baroness
      herself told us that there were no other save men-servants here and that
      they were all spies. Without a master, I cannot see that they are
      dangerous. One needs, however, to watch all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you see anything suspicious,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;tap the table with your
      forefinger. Personally, I will admit that I have had my doubts of the
      Baroness, but on the whole I have come to the conclusion that they were
      groundless. She is not the sort of woman to take up a vendetta, especially
      an unprofitable one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is an exceedingly dangerous person for an impressionable man like
      myself,&rdquo; Sogrange remarked, arranging his tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler fetched them in a very few moments and showed them into a
      pleasantly-furnished library, where he mixed cocktails for them from a
      collection of bottles upon the sideboard. He was quite friendly and
      inclined to be loquacious, although he spoke with a slight foreign accent.
      The house belonged to an English gentleman from whom the honored Count had
      taken it, furnished. They were two miles from a station and a mile from
      the village. It was a lonely part, but there were always people coming or
      going. With one&rsquo;s work one scarcely noticed it. He was gratified that the
      gentlemen found his cocktails so excellent. Perhaps he might be permitted
      the high honor of mixing them another? It was a day, this, of deep sadness
      and gloom. One needed to drink something, indeed, to forget the terrible
      thing which had happened. The Count had been a good master, a little
      impatient sometimes, but kind-hearted. The news had been a shock to them
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, before they had expected her, the Baroness reappeared. She wore a
      wonderful gray gown which seemed to be made in a single piece, a gown
      which fitted her tightly, and yet gave her the curious appearance of a
      woman walking without the burden of clothes. Sogrange, Parisian to the
      finger-tips, watched her with admiring approval. She laid her fingers upon
      his arm, although it was towards Peter that her eyes traveled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take me in, Marquis?&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;It is the only formality we
      will allow ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered a long, low dining-room, paneled with oak, and with the
      family portraits of the owner of the house still left upon the wall.
      Dinner was served upon a round table and was laid for four. There was a
      profusion of silver, very beautiful glass, and a wonderful cluster of
      orchids. The Marquis, as he handed his hostess to her chair, glanced
      towards the vacant place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for my companion, an Austrian lady,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;To-night,
      however, I think that she will not come. She was a distant connection of
      Bernadine&rsquo;s and she is much upset. We leave her place and see. You will
      sit on my other side, Baron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fingers which touched Peter&rsquo;s arm brushed his hand, and were withdrawn
      as though with reluctance. She sank into her chair with a little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is charming of you two, this,&rdquo; she declared, softly. &ldquo;You help me
      through this night of solitude and sadness. What I should do if I were
      alone, I cannot tell. You must drink with me a toast, if you will. Will
      you make it to our better acquaintance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No soup had been offered and champagne was served with the hors d&rsquo;oeuvre.
      Peter raised his glass and looked into the eyes of the woman who was
      leaning so closely towards him that her soft breath fell upon his cheek.
      She whispered something in his ear. For a moment, perhaps, he was carried
      away, but for a moment only. Then Sogrange&rsquo;s voice and the beat of his
      forefinger upon the table stiffened him into sudden alertness. They heard
      a motor car draw up outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo; the Baroness exclaimed, setting her glass down abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, perhaps, our fourth guest who arrives,&rdquo; Sogrange remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all three listened, Peter and Sogrange with their glasses still
      suspended in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our fourth guest?&rdquo; the Baroness repeated. &ldquo;Madame von Estenier is
      upstairs, lying down. I cannot tell who this may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips were parted. The lines of her forehead had suddenly appeared. Her
      eyes were turned toward the door, hard and bright. Then the glass which
      she had nervously picked up again and was holding between her fingers,
      fell on to the tablecloth with a little crash, and the yellow wine ran
      bubbling on to her plate. Her scream echoed to the roof and rang through
      the room. It was Bernadine who stood there in the doorway, Bernadine in a
      long traveling ulster and the air of one newly arrived from a journey.
      They all three looked at him, but there was not one who spoke. The
      Baroness, after her one wild cry, was dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am indeed fortunate,&rdquo; Bernadine said. &ldquo;You have as yet, I see, scarcely
      commenced. You probably expected me. I am charmed to find so agreeable a
      party awaiting my arrival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He divested himself of his ulster and threw it across the arm of the
      butler, who stood behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;for a man who has just been killed in a railway accident,
      I find myself with an appetite. A glass of wine, Carl. I do not know what
      that toast was, the drinking of which my coming interrupted, but let us
      all drink it together. Aimee, my love to you, dear. Let me congratulate
      you upon the fortitude and courage with which you ignored those lying
      reports of my death. I had fears that I might find you alone in a darkened
      room, with tear-stained eyes and sal volatile by your side. This is
      infinitely better. Gentlemen, you are welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange lifted his glass and bowed courteously. Peter followed suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; Sogrange murmured, &ldquo;the Press nowadays becomes more unreliable
      every day. It is apparent, my dear Von Hern, that this account of your
      death was, to say the least of it, exaggerated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter said nothing. His eyes were fixed upon the Baroness. She sat in her
      chair quite motionless, but her face had become like the face of some
      graven image. She looked at Bernadine, but her eyes said nothing. Every
      glint of expression seemed to have left her features. Since that one wild
      shriek she had remained voiceless. Encompassed by danger though he knew
      they now must be, Peter found himself possessed by one thought only. Was
      this a trap into which they had fallen, or was the woman, too, deceived?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bring later news from Paris than I myself,&rdquo; Sogrange proceeded,
      helping himself to one of the dishes which a footman was passing round.
      &ldquo;How did you reach the coast? The evening papers stated distinctly that
      since the accident no attempt had been made to run trains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By motor car from Chantilly,&rdquo; Bernadine replied. &ldquo;I had the misfortune to
      lose my servant, who was wearing my coat, and who, I gather from the
      newspaper reports, was mistaken for me. I myself was unhurt. I hired a
      motor car and drove to Boulogne&mdash;not the best of journeys, let me
      tell you, for we broke down three times. There was no steamer there, but I
      hired a fishing boat, which brought me across the Channel in something
      under eight hours. From the coast I motored direct here. I was so
      anxious,&rdquo; he added, raising his eyes, &ldquo;to see how my dear friend&mdash;my
      dear Aimee&mdash;was bearing the terrible news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fluttered for a moment like a bird in a trap. Peter drew a little sigh
      of relief. His self-respect was reinstated. He had decided that she was
      innocent. Upon them, at least, would not fall the ignominy of having been
      led into the simplest of traps by this white-faced Delilah. The butler had
      brought her another glass, which she raised to her lips. She drained its
      contents, but the ghastliness of her appearance remained unchanged. Peter,
      watching her, knew the signs. She was sick with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The conditions throughout France are indeed awful,&rdquo; Sogrange remarked.
      &ldquo;They say, too, that this railway strike is only the beginning of worse
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your country, dear Marquis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is on its last legs. No one knows
      better than I that it is, at the present moment, honeycombed with sedition
      and anarchical impulses. The people are rotten. For years the whole tone
      of France has been decadent. Its fall must even now be close at hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take a gloomy view of my country&rsquo;s future,&rdquo; Sogrange declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should one refuse to face facts?&rdquo; Bernadine replied. &ldquo;One does not
      often talk so frankly, but we three are met together this evening under
      somewhat peculiar circumstances. The days of the glory of France are past.
      England has laid out her neck for the yoke of the conqueror. Both are
      doomed to fall. Both are ripe for the great humiliation. You two gentlemen
      whom I have the honor to receive as my guests,&rdquo; he concluded, filling his
      glass and bowing towards them, &ldquo;in your present unfortunate predicament
      represent precisely the position of your two countries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ave Caesar!&rdquo; Peter muttered grimly, raising his glass to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine accepted the challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not I, alas! who may call myself Caesar,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;although it
      is certainly you who are about to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange turned to the man who stood behind his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I might trouble you for a little dry toast?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;A modern
      but very uncomfortable ailment,&rdquo; he added, with a sigh. &ldquo;One&rsquo;s digestion
      must march with the years, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your toast you shall have, with pleasure, Marquis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but as for
      your indigestion, do not let that trouble you any longer. I think that I
      can promise you immunity from that annoying complaint for the rest of your
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are doing your best,&rdquo; Peter declared, leaning back in his chair, &ldquo;to
      take away my appetite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine looked searchingly from one to the other of his two guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;you are brave men. I do not know why I should ever
      have doubted it. Your pose is excellent. I have no wish, however, to see
      you buoyed up by a baseless optimism. A somewhat remarkable chance has
      delivered you into my hands. You are my prisoners. You, Peter, Baron de
      Grost, I have hated all my days. You have stood between me and the
      achievement of some of my most dearly-cherished tasks. Always I have said
      to myself that the day of reckoning must come. It has arrived. As for you,
      Marquis de Sogrange, if my personal feelings towards you are less violent,
      you still represent the things absolutely inimical to me and my interests.
      The departure of you two men was the one thing necessary for the
      successful completion of certain tasks which I have in hand at the present
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter pushed away his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have succeeded in destroying my appetite, Count,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Now
      that you have gone so far in expounding your amiable resolutions towards
      us, perhaps you will go a little further and explain exactly how, in this
      eminently respectable house, situated, I understand, in an eminently
      respectable neighborhood, with a police station within a mile, and a dozen
      or so witnesses as to our present whereabouts, you intend to expedite our
      removal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernadine pointed toward the woman who sat facing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the Baroness how these things are arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned towards her. She fell back in her chair with a little gasp.
      She had fainted. Bernadine shrugged his shoulders. The butler and one of
      the footmen, who during the whole of the conversation had stolidly
      proceeded with their duties, in obedience to a gesture from their master
      took her up in their arms and carried her from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fear has come to her, too,&rdquo; Bernadine murmured, softly. &ldquo;It may come
      to you, my brave friends, before morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; Peter answered, his hand stealing around to his hip
      pocket, &ldquo;but in the meantime, what is to prevent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hip pocket was empty. Peter&rsquo;s sentence ended abruptly. Bernadine
      mocked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To prevent your shooting me in cold blood, I suppose,&rdquo; he remarked.
      &ldquo;Nothing except that my servants are too clever. No one save myself is
      allowed to remain under this roof with arms in their possession. Your
      pocket was probably picked before you had been in the place five minutes.
      No, my dear Baron, let me assure you that escape will not be so easy! You
      were always just a little inclined to be led away by the fair sex. The
      best men in the world, you know, have shared that failing, and the
      Baroness, alone and unprotected, had her attractions, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then something happened to Peter which had happened to him barely a dozen
      times in his life. He lost his temper and lost it rather badly. Without an
      instant&rsquo;s hesitation, he caught up the decanter which stood by his side
      and flung it in his host&rsquo;s face. Bernadine only partly avoided it by
      thrusting out his arms. The neck caught his forehead and the blood came
      streaming over his tie and collar. Peter had followed the decanter with a
      sudden spring. His fingers were upon Bernadine&rsquo;s throat and he thrust his
      head back. Sogrange sprang to the door to lock it, but he was too late.
      The room seemed full of men-servants. Peter was dragged away, still
      struggling fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie them up!&rdquo; Bernadine gasped, swaying in his chair. &ldquo;Tie them up, do
      you hear? Carl, give me brandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swallowed half a wineglassful of the raw spirit. His eyes were red with
      fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them to the gun room,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;three of you to each of them,
      mind. I&rsquo;ll shoot the man who lets either escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Peter and Sogrange were both of them too wise to expend any more of
      their strength in a useless struggle. They suffered themselves to be
      conducted without resistance across the white stone hall, down a long
      passage, and into a room at the end, the window and fireplace of which
      were both blocked up. The floor was of red flags and the walls
      whitewashed. The only furniture was a couple of kitchen chairs and a long
      table. The door was of stout oak and fitted with a double lock. The sole
      outlet, so far as they could see, was a small round hole at the top of the
      roof. The door was locked behind them. They were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The odd trick to Bernadine!&rdquo; Peter exclaimed hoarsely, wiping a spot of
      blood from his forehead. &ldquo;My dear Marquis, I scarcely know how to
      apologize. It is not often that I lose my temper so completely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter seems to be of very little consequence,&rdquo; Sogrange answered.
      &ldquo;This was probably our intended destination in any case. Seems to be
      rather an unfortunate expedition of ours, I am afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One cannot reckon upon men coming back from the dead,&rdquo; Peter declared.
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t often that you find every morning and every evening paper
      mistaken. As for the woman, I believe in her. She honestly meant to sell
      us those papers of Bernadine&rsquo;s. I believe that she, too, will have to face
      a day of reckoning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange strolled around the room, subjecting it everywhere to a close
      scrutiny. The result was hopeless. There was no method of escape save
      through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is certainly something strange about this apartment,&rdquo; Peter
      remarked. &ldquo;It is, to say the least of it, unusual to have windows in the
      roof and a door of such proportions. All the same, I think that those
      threats of Bernadine&rsquo;s were a little strained. One cannot get rid of one&rsquo;s
      enemies, nowadays, in the old-fashioned, melodramatic way. Bernadine must
      know quite well that you and I are not the sort of men to walk into a trap
      of any one&rsquo;s setting, just as I am quite sure that he is not the man to
      risk even a scandal by breaking the law openly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You interest me,&rdquo; Sogrange said. &ldquo;I begin to suspect that you, too, have
      made some plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But naturally,&rdquo; Peter replied. &ldquo;Once before Bernadine set a trap for me
      and he nearly had a chance of sending me for a swim in the Thames. Since
      then one takes precautions as a matter of course. We were followed down
      here, and by this time I should imagine that the alarm is given. If all
      was well, I was to have telephoned an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really,&rdquo; Sogrange declared, &ldquo;quite an agreeable companion, my
      dear Baron. You think of everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was suddenly opened. Bernadine stood upon the threshold and
      behind him several of the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will oblige me by stepping back into the study, my friends,&rdquo; he
      ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With great pleasure,&rdquo; Sogrange answered, with alacrity. &ldquo;We have no fancy
      for this room, I can assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more they crossed the stone hall and entered the room into which they
      had first been shown. On the threshold, Peter stopped short and listened.
      It seemed to him that from somewhere upstairs he could hear the sound of a
      woman&rsquo;s sobs. He turned to Bernadine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baroness is not unwell, I trust?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baroness is as well as she is likely to be for some time,&rdquo; Bernadine
      replied, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all in the study now. Upon a table stood a telephone instrument.
      Bernadine drew a small revolver from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baron de Grost,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I find that you are not quite such a fool as I
      thought you. Some one is ringing up for you on the telephone. You will
      reply that you are well and safe and that you will be home as soon as your
      business here is finished. Your wife is at the other end. If you breathe a
      single word to her of your approaching end, she shall hear through the
      telephone the sound of the revolver shot that sends you to Hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; Peter protested, &ldquo;I find this most unpleasant. If you will
      excuse me, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll answer the call at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will answer it as I have directed,&rdquo; Bernadine insisted. &ldquo;Only
      remember this&mdash;if you speak a single ill-advised word, the end will
      be as I have said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter picked up the receiver and held it to his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Violet whose voice he heard. He listened for a moment to her
      anxious flood of questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not the slightest cause to be alarmed, dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, I
      am down at the High House, near St. Mary&rsquo;s. Bernadine is here. It seems
      that those reports of his death were absolutely unfounded.... Danger?
      Unprotected? Why, my dear Violet, you know how careful I always am. Simply
      because Bernadine used once to live here, and because the Baroness was his
      friend, I spoke to Sir John Dory over the telephone before we left, and an
      escort of half-a-dozen police followed us. They are about the place now, I
      have no doubt, but their presence is quite unnecessary. I shall be home
      before long, dear.... Yes, perhaps it would be as well to send the car
      down. Any one will direct him to the house&mdash;the High House, St.
      Mary&rsquo;s, remember. Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter replaced the receiver and turned slowly round. Bernadine was
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did well to reassure your wife, even though it was a pack of lies you
      told her,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter shrugged his shoulders contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Bernadine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;up till now I have tried to take you
      seriously. You are really passing the limit. I must positively ask you to
      reflect a little. Do men who live the life that you and I live, trust any
      one? Am I&mdash;is the Marquis de Sogrange here&mdash;after a lifetime of
      experience, likely to leave the safety of our homes in company with a lady
      of whom we knew nothing except that she was your companion, without
      precautions? I do you the justice to believe you a person of commonsense.
      I know that we are as safe in this house as we should be in our own. War
      cannot be made in this fashion in an over-policed country like England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be too sure,&rdquo; Bernadine replied. &ldquo;There are secrets about this
      house which have not yet been disclosed to you. There are means, my dear
      Baron, of transporting you into a world where you are likely to do much
      less harm than here, means ready at hand, and which would leave no more
      trace behind than those crumbling ashes can tell of the coal mine from
      which they came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter preserved his attitude of bland incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, drawing a whistle from his pocket, &ldquo;it is just possible
      that you are in earnest. I will bet you, then, if you like, a hundred
      pounds, that if I blow this whistle you will either have to open your door
      within five minutes or find your house invaded by the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one spoke for several moments. The veins were standing out upon
      Bernadine&rsquo;s forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had enough of this folly,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If you refuse to realize
      your position, so much the worse for you. Blow your whistle, if you will.
      I am content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter waited for no second bidding. He raised the whistle to his lips and
      blew it, loudly and persistently. Again there was silence. Bernadine
      mocked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try once more, dear Baron,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;Your friends are perhaps a
      little hard of hearing. Try once more, and when you have finished, you and
      I and the Marquis de Sogrange will find our way once more to the gun room
      and conclude that trifling matter of business which brought you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Peter blew his whistle and again the silence was broken only by
      Bernadine&rsquo;s laugh. Suddenly, however, that laugh was checked. Every one
      had turned toward the door, listening. A bell was ringing throughout the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the front door!&rdquo; one of the servants exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one moved. As though to put the matter beyond doubt, there was a steady
      knocking to be heard from the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a telegram or some late caller,&rdquo; Bernadine declared, hoarsely.
      &ldquo;Answer it, Carl. If any one would speak with the Baroness, she is
      indisposed and unable to receive. If any one desires me, I am here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man left the room. They heard him withdraw the chain from the door.
      Bernadine wiped the sweat from his forehead as he listened. He still
      gripped the revolver in his hand. Peter had changed his position a little
      and was standing now behind a high-backed chair. They heard the door creak
      open, a voice outside, and presently the tramp of heavy footsteps. Peter
      nodded understandingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is exactly as I told you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You were wise not to bet, my
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the tramp of feet in the hall. There was something unmistakable
      about the sound, something final and terrifying. Bernadine saw his triumph
      slipping away. Once more this man who had defied him so persistently, was
      to taste the sweets of victory. With a roar of fury he sprang across the
      room. He fired his revolver twice before Sogrange, with a terrible blow,
      knocked his arm upwards and sent the weapon spinning to the ceiling. Peter
      struck his assailant in the mouth, but the blow seemed scarcely to check
      him. They rolled on the floor together, their arms around one another&rsquo;s
      necks. It was an affair, that, but of a moment. Peter, as lithe as a cat,
      was on his feet again almost at once, with a torn collar and an ugly mark
      on his face. There were strangers in the room now and the servants had
      mostly slipped away during the confusion. It was Sir John Dory himself who
      locked the door. Bernadine struggled slowly to his feet. He was face to
      face with half a dozen police constables in plain clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a charge against this man, Baron?&rdquo; the police commissioner
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The quarrel between us,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;is not for the police courts,
      although I will confess, Sir John, that your intervention was opportune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, on the other hand,&rdquo; Sogrange put in, &ldquo;demand the arrest of the Count
      von Hern and the seizure of all papers in this house. I am the bearer of
      an autograph letter from the President of France in connection with this
      matter. The Count von Hern has committed extraditable offenses against my
      country. I am prepared to swear an information to that effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The police commissioner turned to Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marquis de Sogrange,&rdquo; Peter told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a person of authority?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my certain knowledge,&rdquo; Peter replied, &ldquo;he has the implicit confidence
      of the French Government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir John Dory made a sign. In another moment Bernadine would have been
      arrested. It seemed, indeed, as though nothing could save him now from
      this crowning humiliation. He himself, white and furious, was at a loss
      how to deal with an unexpected situation. Suddenly a thing happened
      stranger than any one of them there had ever dreamed of, so strange that
      even men such as Peter, Sogrange and Dory, whose nerves were of iron,
      faced one another, doubting and amazed. The floor beneath them rocked and
      billowed like the waves of a canvas sea. The windows were filled with
      flashes of red light, a great fissure parted the wall, the pictures and
      book-cases came crashing down beneath a shower of masonry. It was the
      affair of a second. Above them shone the stars and around them a noise
      like thunder. Bernadine, who alone understood, was the first to recover
      himself. He stood in the midst of them, his hands above his head, laughing
      as he looked around at the strange storm, laughing like a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wonderful Carl,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Oh, matchless servant. Arrest me now, if
      you will, you dogs of the police. Rout out my secrets, dear Baron de
      Grost. Tuck them under your arm and hurry to Downing Street. This is the
      hospitality of the High House, my friends. It loves you so well that only
      your ashes shall leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mouth was open for another sentence when he was struck. A whole pillar
      of marble from one of the rooms above came crashing through and buried him
      underneath a falling shower of masonry. Peter escaped by a few inches.
      Those who were left unhurt sprang through the yawning wall out into the
      garden. Sir John, Sogrange and Peter, three of the men&mdash;one limping
      badly, came to a standstill in the middle of the lawn. Before them, the
      house was crumbling like a pack of cards, and louder even than the thunder
      of the falling structure was the roar of the red flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baroness!&rdquo; Peter cried, and took one leap forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; she sobbed, running to them from out of the shadows. &ldquo;I have
      lost everything&mdash;my jewels, my clothes, all except what I have on.
      They gave me but a moment&rsquo;s warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any one else in the house?&rdquo; Peter demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one but you who were in that room,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your companion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no companion,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;I thought it sounded better to
      speak of her. I had her place laid at table, but she never even existed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter tore off his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the others in the room!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We must go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange caught him by the shoulder and pointed to a shadowy group some
      distance away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all out but Bernadine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For him were is no hope. Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sprang back only just in time. The outside wall of the house fell
      with a terrible crash. The room which they had quitted was blotted now out
      of existence. From right and left, in all directions along the country
      road, came the flashing of lights and little knots of hurrying people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the end!&rdquo; Peter muttered. &ldquo;Yesterday I should have regretted the
      passing of a brave enemy. To-day I hail with joy the death of a brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness, who had been sitting upon a garden seat, sobbing, came
      softly up to them. She laid her fingers upon Peter&rsquo;s arm imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not leave me friendless?&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;The papers I promised you
      are destroyed, but many of his secrets are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tapped her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; Peter answered, &ldquo;I have no wish to know them. Years ago I swore
      that the passing of Bernadine should mark my own retirement from the world
      in which we both lived. I shall keep my word. To-night Bernadine is dead.
      To-night, Sogrange, my work is finished.&rdquo; The Baroness began to sob again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thought that you were a man,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;so gallant, so honorable&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; Sogrange intervened, &ldquo;I shall commend you to the pension list of
      the Double-Four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dried her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not money only I want,&rdquo; she whispered, her eyes following Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sogrange shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never seen the Baroness de Grost?&rdquo; he asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Sogrange murmured.... &ldquo;Our escort, madame, is at your service&mdash;as
      far as London.&rdquo;
     </p>

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
